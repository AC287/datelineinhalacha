  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c37 title"><span class="c13 c36">The topic of the date line has always intrigued me. Not only is the subject matter fascinating, but by delving into the various related sugyos, one gains new insights into them. &nbsp;For example, must Shabbos be a full 24-hour period, or can one end Shabbos earlier by just crossing the date line? Do sunrise and sunset determine the obligation of Tefila, or rather does a change of longitude?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c37 title"><span class="c13 c36">After completing my </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Sefer Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">, I realized how germane these halachos were for the contemporary English speaking travelers. &nbsp;I have therefore asked my brother-in-law, Zolly Tropper, who is one of the frequent date line crossers himself, to adapt my sefer into English for the traveling public.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c37 title"><span class="c13 c36">I have thoroughly reviewed the English manuscript and I commend its author for capturing the essence of the </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">. The presentation of the halachos is accurate and concise. &nbsp;From the many discussions that I had with my brother-in-law I have learned how difficult it is to adapt a 700 page sefer into a 70 page English version. Knowing what to omit is far more difficult than knowing what to include. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c37 title"><span class="c13 c36">It is my fervent prayer that the English </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Kitzur Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">&nbsp;serve the public well.</span>

  <p class="c15 c24 title"><span class="c5 c8 c6"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">Previous seforim dealing with the topic of the date line primarily focus on its halachic location. They do not address the many complex issues raised when one actually does cross the date line. It is for this reason that Rav Yisroel Taplin&rsquo;s </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">&nbsp;is so unique in its fresh approach to this area of study. Besides addressing the the date line location issues, </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">&nbsp;analyzes the many other matters involved when one crosses the date line and how to conduct oneself in accordance with halacha under various circumstances. For example, how does crossing the date line affect the number of tefilos one must say when the day of the week changes midday? What impact does crossing the date line have on mitzvos that are dependent on a specific day or date, e.g. Shabbos, Matzo, Shofar? Does crossing the date line affect mitzvos that are dependent on a day count, e.g. Sefiras Haomer, Bris Mila?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">Besides his own expertise due to years of study, Rav Taplin has discussed many of the issues with today&rsquo;s leading poskim. An appreciation of the breadth and depth of this study can be gained by taking a quick glance at the detailed table of contents of his sefer.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">At the request of Rav Taplin, I have adapted portions of </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">&nbsp;for the English reading public. I have attempted to highlight some of the points that are applicable to the common overseas traveler. A summary of conclusions is listed in the last chapter which should act as a guide. However, since the nature of the subject matter is rather complex, competent rabbinic authority must be sought in case of doubt.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">Although the </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">Kitzur Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c13 c36">&nbsp;was reviewed by Rav Taplin, there is always room for misunderstandings due to my unclear presentation of the material. It is my hope and prayer that no misunderstandings result from it and that thiswork acts as a reference to the public. I am most grateful for having been able to be a part of this project.</span>

  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">It is almost impossible to properly thank all those involved, since this work would not have been possible without the generous assistance of colleagues and friends too numerous to mention. However, I would be remiss if I did not give special thanks to &nbsp;Yechiel Nakdimen, who painstakingly reviewed the original drafts and literally rewrote large segments of this work. I am deeply grateful for his insights and input which are felt on every page. He has left an indelible imprint on the final version of this book.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c15 c20 c30 title"><span class="c13 c36">Special thanks to my rebbi, Rav Tuvia Goldstein, who has taught me time and time again, that the essence of learning is </span><span class="c35 c13 c36">la&rsquo;asukei shma&rsquo;atsa eliba dehilchasa</span><span class="c13 c36">, to seek the halacha lemaaseh from all that we learn.</span>

  </p>
  <p class="c15 c24 title"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The legendary heroic efforts of the Japanese Consul Senpo Sughihara on behalf of thousands of Jews trying to escape the horrors of Europe during World War II have been carefully recorded.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;The precious Japanese visas that Sughihara issued, offered their holders the opportunity to flee Europe via Japan. This endeavor has interestingly not only contributed to the physical survival of our nation, but was a catalyst for some new and very exciting discoveries in the world of halacha</span><span class="c0">. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Students of two famous yeshivos, Mir and Chachmei Lublin,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">were among those who were rescued. Both groups were aware that according to some Rishonim</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the halachic date line is located just east of the 125E meridian. &nbsp;As Japan is located on the 140E meridian, during the long trek from Eastern Europe to Japan, the halachic date line was crossed, and the halachic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">day of the week changed to the prior day, i.e. Monday became Sunday. Even though the residents of the country through which they were traveling (eastern Siberia and China) considered the day of the week to be &nbsp;Monday, according to many Rishonim, halacha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">considered that day to be Sunday.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Consequently, Yom Kippur 5702 (1941) which was to fall on a Wednesday, would seemingly have to have been observed on what was considered by the local population of Japan to be Thursday. Since the practical application of the psak halacha had heretofore not been fully explored, telegrams were sent to Eretz Yisroel requesting guidance from the contemporary poskim. The Gerer Rebbe, after consultation with Rav Yechiel Michel Tukatzinsky (the leading calendar expert in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Eretz Yisroel), instructed the students of Yeshiva Chachmei Lublin to observe Yom</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Kippur on the Japanese Wednesday. According to Rav Tukatzinsky the halachic date line had not been crossed on the eastward trek from Europe to Japan. The Chazon Ish however, in reply to Rav Yechezkel Levenstein and Rav Chaim Shmulevitz of the Mir Yeshiva, ruled, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Ichlu berivii vetzumu bachamishi&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">&ndash; &ldquo;Eat on Wednesday and fast on Thursday&rdquo;. This difference of opinion catapulted this theoretical question to the forefront of practical halacha.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">One needs to understand why Chazal did not address this issue. That they perceived the world to be round is evident from a number of sources,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;and consequently a date line somewhere on the globe is a logical necessity.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Although the date line question may have had no practical application to the times of Chazal, the theoretical study of the subject certainly seems in order. We find several cases where Chazal did in fact study &nbsp;halachos that had no practical applications.</span><sup class="c9 c5"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, we find that study of purely theoretical questions for the sake of theory alone, was often discouraged by Chazal. The Gemara in Sanhedrin 71, after a lengthy discussion of the laws of </span><span class="c0">ben sorer umoreh</span><span class="c4">, questions the validity of the opinion of R&rsquo; Shimon who says that </span><span class="c0">ben sorer umoreh </span><span class="c4">is a practical impossibility. Implicit in the Gemara&rsquo;s question is that purely theoretical questions have no place in halacha unless they can have practical implications. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">We find several other cases in the Gemara, where Tannaim and Amoraim who ask purely hypothetical questions, are rebuked in the strongest of terms. In Menachos 37, Plimo was threatened with shamta, a form of excommunication, for raising the hypothetical question of how does a two headed person don tefilin. The Gemara in Baba Basra 23 relates that Rav Yirmiya was dismissed from the Beis Hamedrash for having asked a question involving something physically impossible despite its hypothetical merit.. In each of these cases Rashi remarks that the sharp rebukes were because such hypothetical questions were considered a mockery of the law, or simply a waste of time. Halacha usually deals with the here and now; the near impossible or far fetched improbable has to have practical or philosophical implications.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">It may be that for this very reason, that so basic an issue as the location of the date line, is not discussed in the Gemara</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">at all. Interestingly, not until the 12</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;century is the issue raised in halacha, and there only in the context of solving a problem concerning another subject.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Consequently, halacha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">codifiers, including the Rambam, Rosh, Tur and Shulchan Aruch do not address the subject of the date line at all. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">During this century, observant Jews began crossing the date line on a regular basis. Nevertheless, many &nbsp;people are not even aware that the location of the date line is a question of halacha at all. Most trans-Pacific airplanes are equipped with video monitors that display the altitude, speed and location during the entire duration of the long overseas flight. The precise time at which the plane crosses the International Date Line is clear to all. Needless to say, the halachic date line is not to be found on the airlines&rsquo; maps. Hence, most travelers innocently accept the pilot&rsquo;s announcement that, &ldquo;We have just crossed the date line&rdquo;, at face value. However, the vast majority of poskim do not consider the International Date Line, to be synonymous with the halachic date line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Typical questions asked of Rabbonim have focused on how many times to daven or when to put on tefilin during the flight. While these questions are indeed very important, and are dealt with in this book, the more basic question of whether one is in fact crossing the date line is often not even raised. And even if one would ask this basic question, a clear psak is most often elusive. The complex nature of the subject matter, the very diverse views among contemporary poskim, and the dearth of halachic material relating to this topic, make clear directives difficult.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The purpose of this book is to present the reader with the halachic ramifications of crossing the date line. We will set forth the halachic theory upon which each of the various questions is based, as well as how the theory can be applied in practice. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c33 c30 c32"><span class="c4">The topics we will discuss can be broadly divided into three major areas. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c48 c34 c32"><span class="c4">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there in fact a halachic date line?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c48 c34 c32"><span class="c4">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one conduct oneslf when &nbsp;located in a part of the world that considers the day of the week to be different than the one prescribed by halacha?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c34 c32 c48"><span class="c4">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What effect does crossing the date line have on specific mitzvos; Krias Shma, Tefila, Tefilin, Sefiras Haomer, to name a few?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Our presentation will consist of an in depth examination of each topic, a final chapter outlining the conclusions reached by the author, and a practical guide. &nbsp;Anyone interested in gaining a more profound understanding, is encouraged to study the source sefer itself.</span>

  <h1 class="c15 c31"><span class="c8 c13 c18">Is there a Halachic Date Line?</span></h1>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Every map of the world has a very clear zigzag line running vertically through the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Japan called the International Date Line. This date line is the arbitrary longitudinal line 180 degrees from Greenwich, England, that has been accepted by world convention just over 100 years ago to be the place on Earth where the day changes.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Where the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian cuts through a landmass, international convention has determined that the line be drawn around country borders. This was done to avoid the inconvenience of dividing a single country into two different days. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">In order to establish the criteria to determine the date line&rsquo;s halachic location, we must first explain the concept itself, its necessity, and the ramifications thereof.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">The Concept of a Date Line</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The concept of a date line can be somewhat confusing and difficult to grasp. A graphic description might be the best place to start. Suppose you are standing in New York at 6 AM on Monday. At that moment we know that the time in Israel is seven hours later, making local Israel time 1 PM. Looking six time zones to the east of Israel, to Taiwan, the local time will be 7 PM on Monday. When it is 6 AM in New York, it is 1 PM in Israel, and 7 PM in Taiwan. That would make local time in Taiwan thirteen hours ahead of New York. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">As we study a map of the world, we find that as we move our finger to the right in an eastward direction, each time zone which measures 15 longitudinal degrees, adds one hour to the local time. Moving across the Pacific Ocean to California, we will pass over approximately 1/3 of the world or 120 degrees. Since we add one hour for each 15 degrees to the east, local time in California should be eight hours ahead of Taiwan. If so, then at 7 PM on Monday in Taiwan, it must be 3 AM Tuesday in California, i.e. 21 hours ahead of New York. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If we finish our study by moving our finger to the east across the United States, then at 3 AM on Tuesday in California it is 5 AM in Chicago, and 6 AM Tuesday at our starting point in New York. But that cannot be, for we began our study of the map in New York at 6 AM on Monday! In short we have shown that at 6 AM Monday in New York, it is 1 PM Monday in Israel, 7 PM Monday in Taiwan, 3 AM &nbsp;Tuesday in California, which should be 6 AM Tuesday in New York. Evidently, somewhere on the map, the day of the week had to change. The result is that what we claimed to be 3 AM on Tuesday in California, is in fact 3 AM on Monday. In other words, California time is 3 hours behind New York, rather than 21 hours ahead of it.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Having demonstrated that there is a point on Earth where the day must change, how do we go about determining that point&rsquo;s location? In the late 19</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;century, the international community agreed on a convenient place in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This sparsely inhabited area that separates continents, specifically, the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian, &nbsp;is approximately four hours east of Taiwan. This zigzag line on our maps that is near the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian is known as The International Date Line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The mechanism whereby the date changes at the International Date Line (IDL) can be described as follows. The world is divided into 24 time zones and each time zone measures 15 longitudinal degrees. The time zone that begins at the IDL, at the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian, that extends 15 degrees westward to the 165E meridian will be referred to as time zone no. 1. Time zone no. 2 spans the distance between the longitudes of 165E to 150E. As we continue westward all the way around the globe, we reach time zone no. 24, which covers the distance between the 165W meridian and the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian (the International Date Line).</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">When it is midnight on Sunday at the IDL, the date west of the date line is pushed forward to Monday. Hence, at time zone no. 1 it is the first hour (12:00 AM or 00:00 military time) of the day Monday. The date has not been changed yet for the other 23 time zones on the world, where it is still Sunday. Hence, at time zone no. 2, it is 11 PM on Sunday, and the day will change only when midnight reaches that time zone. At time zone no. 24, it is 1 AM Sunday. Monday will not reach time zone no. 24 for another 23 hours. Hence, to one standing just east of the IDL in time zone 24, it is 1:00 AM Sunday, while to one standing just west of the IDL, it is 12:00 AM Monday. Time zone no. &nbsp;24 is 23 hours behind time zone no. 1, not one hour ahead of it. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">The Date Line in Halacha</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The very first mitzva that we received as a nation was that of the Jewish calendar</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c4">. Knowledge of the proper day and date is essential to the performance of many mitzvos of the Torah. </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate between the day and the night; and they shall be for signs, and for festivals, and for days and years.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;It is obvious that any aspect of so basic a tenet of the Torah as the calendar, should be discernable from the halachic literature available to us. Where then do we begin our search?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Scientifically speaking, a day is the time it takes the earth to make one complete rotation on its axis. Since to the observer on Earth the opposite seems to take place, for illustrative purposes we will take the liberty of referring to the sun as figuratively revolving around the Earth as it moves from east to west in the sky.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Unlike the secular date which begins at midnight, the halachic day begins at sunset, with the day following the night. Hence, sunset on Sunday evening is the beginning of Monday. As sunset continues from east to west, a new day is ushered in at each successive point on Earth.</span><span class="c19 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">While a circle may have no beginning or end, in order for a day to change to the next day, there must be a starting point. &nbsp;Without a starting point, i.e. a date line, we reach the logical impossibility of it being 6 AM Monday and 6 AM Tuesday in New York at the same time.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The halachic date line is thus defined as the point on the globe where the day begins at sunset. When sunset reaches that point, the date is pushed forward. Sunset on Sunday night at the halachic date line is the beginning of Monday. For the 23 time zones</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;to the east of that point it is still Sunday. &nbsp;As the sunset travels westward, more and more of the earth is ushering in Monday until, when sunset reaches the final mile just east of the halachic date line, it is Monday in the entire world except for this final mile. As soon as sunset reaches the date line, the date is pushed forward to Tuesday.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Consequently, one who crosses the date line from east to west would be moving ahead one day, while one who crosses the date line from west to east would be moving back to an earlier day.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Baal Hamaor</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Baal Hamaor, a contemporary of The Rambam and Raavad, is the first early authority to touch upon the concept of the date line. In order to explain a difficult passage in the Gemara Rosh Hashana 20b regarding the laws of Kiddush Hachodesh he uses a tradition that he heard from his teachers that refers to </span><span class="c0">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c4">, the eastern edge of the world. His explanation makes sense only if there is an international date line 90 degrees east of Jerusalem.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Jerusalem is located approximately 15 miles east of the 35E meridian.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;The point 90 degrees east of Jerusalem at the 125.2E meridian, cuts through Siberia, China, the Philippines, and Australia. Korea, Japan and most of Australia, fall to the east of the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s date line but west of the International Date Line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">By identifying the halachic date line as a point other than the International Date Line, we are presented with a serious halachic challenge. If halacha did not recognize the date change that took place at the IDL, the ramifications are enormous. In the 55 degree area between the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s date line (125.2E) and the International Date Line (180), the day that world convention considers Sunday, is in reality the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s halachic Shabbos. Consequently, according to this view, Shabbos would be observed on the Japanese or Korean Sunday</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c4">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Chazon Ish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Chazon Ish states that since the Baal Hamaor is a Rishon, supported by many other Rishonim and disputed by none, his opinion is decisive.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;However, he interprets the Baal Hamaor in a slightly different manner than explained above. He opines that while the date line is undoubtedly at the </span><span class="c0">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c4">, six hours east of Jerusalem, it cannot cut through a landmass.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is because it is inconceivable that for one person the day would be Friday, and for his neighbor next door it would be Shabbos. &nbsp;The Chazon Ish therefore posits the </span><span class="c0">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to be the eastern coast of Asia, approximately 90 degrees east of Jerusalem. However, where the land protrudes beyond 90 degrees, the date line protrudes with it along the coastline. The only place that we do draw a straight line along the 90</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian east of Jerusalem, is in the ocean. Islands to the east of 125.2E are beyond the date line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Accordingly, &nbsp;Korea, Siberia, and the eastern portion of China, are not considered east of the date line even though they are beyond the 90 degree point (125E). Since they are attached to the landmass of Asia that falls to the west of the date line, these three countries are considered to be west of the date line. Eastern Australia likewise would be considered west of the date line, because part of the land mass of Australia is to the west. Japan on the other hand, which is an island located east of the 125E longitude line and not attached to mainland Asia would be considered east of the date line. In short, Shabbos would be observed on Saturday in Korea and Australia, but on Sunday in Japan.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">A point of interest that relates to the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s opinion concerns the status of the ocean along the Asian and Australian coast. Since the coastline is the date line, it would be forbidden on Sunday to travel on the ocean or to even go swimming at the beach of Asia or Australia east of 125E. Points east of the coastline are beyond the date line, i.e. it is Shabbos in the ocean along the coast of eastern Australia on the local Sunday.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">One additional concern is the status of air space in the area that is east of the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s date line but west of the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s. The logic behind the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s extension of the date line beyond 125E is that a single land mass cannot be split into two different days. Air space however is not contingent to the land mass; hence different halachos may apply. There are differing opinions whether or not air space follows the halachos of the land below. &nbsp;If we assume that air space is independent of land, then according to the Chazon Ish, it may be prohibited to fly from the eastern part of Australia westward on Sunday. Although it is considered Sunday on the land below, it may very well be considered Shabbos in the air space, for the air space is east of the 125</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian and not connected to the land mass.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Rav Yechiel Michel Tukatzinsky</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Chazon Ish published this opinion in a lengthy study on the subject entitled </span><span class="c0">Kuntres Yud Ches Shaos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;which appears in his sefer on </span><span class="c0">Orach Chaim</span><span class="c4">, as a response to an article written by Rav Yechiel Michel Tukatzinsky, who took a totally different approach to the date line issue.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Tukatzinsky held that we view Jerusalem as being the center of the world . Although a circle has no beginning or end, if we are to talk of east and west, we must have a reference point from where to start. Jerusalem is that point. Hence, the beginning of day one took place half way around the world, or twelve hours east of Jerusalem. The date line would therefore be situated 180 degrees east of Jerusalem, at the 145.2W meridian. Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line falls in the Pacific Ocean east of Hawaii.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Accordingly, Shabbos would be observed on Saturday in Japan</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c4">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The 35 degree area between Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line and the International Date Line, (from the 180</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian eastward to 145W), is relatively unpopulated. From a practical standpoint, we can usually use the International Date Line as the line where the day changes. There are two states however that are affected by this position; Hawaii and most of Alaska. These areas fall east of the International Date Line but west of Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s halachic date line. Consequently, when one travels from California to Hawaii, Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line is crossed. &nbsp;Therefore, if one left California on Wednesday, upon landing in Hawaii several hours later the day changed en route to Thursday. The local Hawaiians however, who use the International Date Line as their reference point, consider the day to still be Wednesday, since during the above mentioned trip, the International Date Line was not crossed. Wednesday in Hawaii is the halachic Thursday according to Rav Tukatzinsky. Hence, Shabbos would have to be observed on the Hawaiian Friday. The local Saturday would be the halachic Sunday.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">While Rav Tukatzinsky issued this psak as it relates to Hawaii, he is reluctant to come to the same conclusion regarding Alaska. &nbsp;Although most of Alaska does in fact fall in this 35 degree area between the above mentioned date lines, which would result in its having a different halachic day than that practiced by the general population, since Alaska is connected to mainland Canada, one could argue that it is to be considered as part of greater Canada. By adopting the concept of </span><span class="c0">gereira</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;that the Chazon Ish introduced, which states that the date line cannot cut through a solid landmass, Alaska would be pulled to the east and would follow the same day of the week as does the Western Hemisphere. </span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Chazon Ish took strong exception to Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s opinion. He could not understand how Rav Tukatzinsky ignores the opinion of so many Rishonim and issues a psak based on his own logic. For although this opinion seems to make perfect sense, one cannot base halacha on logic when it conflicts with the view of Rishonim.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c5 c25 c8">Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer and Rav Zvi Pesach Frank claim that there is no halachic date line at all.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Since this issue of paramount importance is not even discussed in the Gemara, the Rambam or Shulchan Aruch, there is evidently no particular halachic date line. We therefore follow the day that the people of a particular location believe to be the proper day of the week.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;For all intents and purposes, since world convention adopted the International Date Line, this opinion would adopt the International Date Line as the halachic one as well.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">They base this psak on their drawing conclusions from indirect references to the date line issue mentioned in the Radvaz regarding the question that the Gemara in Shabbos 69b raises with regard to one who is lost in the desert and forgot which day is Shabbos. After a lengthy discussion, the Gemara concludes that one is to count six days and rest on the seventh.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shabbos is determined by one&rsquo;s personal count of seven days.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;In the event that the one who was lost in the desert comes upon a city that observes Shabbos on a day other than the one he was counting, he must adopt their Shabbos, as he becomes subservient or tofel to them. He keeps the local Shabbos. Following this logic, one who crosses the date line must keep the Shabbos of the local inhabitants regardless of his personal count.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Isser Zalman goes on to claim that the strong evidence cited earlier in support of the Baal Hamaor was said in a theoretical vein only; the Baal Hamaor never meant to issue a psak halacha based on his understanding of the Gemara in Rosh Hashana. However, this argument is not at all convincing since the Baal Hamaor very clearly states that this opinion is to be followed lehalacha</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c4">. </span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Rav Yonasan Shteif</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Yonasan Shteif</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c4">, claims that the date line is determined by tradition; the tradition that each country follows. Saturday in Japan is Saturday, because that is the way it&rsquo;s always been. &nbsp;The day of the week considered Saturday in Japan would therefore be our Shabbos as we assume that this has been the tradition since time immemorial. We would therefore follow the day of the local population. &nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">This position however does raise some very interesting questions regarding the proper day of the week to be observed in Alaska. The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. Until that year, Alaska followed the day of the week of Russia, the day observed west of the date line. The day of the week changed to the United States&rsquo; day subsequent to this purchase. If the tradition until 1867 had been that Alaska is west of the date line, then a political change in the map cannot change the day of the week. Rav Shteif therefore holds that &nbsp;Shabbos in Alaska is on the Alaskan Friday.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Sefer Yisroel Vehazmanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;notes that there were other countries that changed the day of the week to satisfy political considerations. He reports that in 1846 the Philippines changed the day of the week from east of the date line to west of it. The </span><span class="c0">Yaavetz</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;reports that a day change took place in India as a result of European conquerors who brought the day of the week with them from their point of origin</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c4">. These historical facts raise serious problems for those who live in the countries that experienced political day changes, according to the view of Rav Yonasan Shteif.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup>

  <h4 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c35 c13">Sefer Ha&rsquo;ibur</span></h4>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">There is an opinion that indicates that the </span><span class="c0">Tibur Haaretz</span><span class="c4">, or the center of the world, is located 23.5</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;or 24</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;degrees to the east of Jerusalem. Using this as our starting point, this opinion follows the logic of the Baal Hamaor who claimed that the date line is 6 hours east of the starting point.

  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Rav Dovid Shapiro</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Dovid Shapiro in his </span><span class="c0">Sefer Bnei Zion</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;quotes a Medrash that states that when the Sun first appeared in the sky, it was at the beginning of the fourth hour of the day in Jerusalem.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; Hence, the sun first appeared 45 degrees east of Jerusalem.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; Sunset, the start of the new day, which took place at that very moment in time six hours east of that point, was nine hours east of Jerusalem, a point 135 degrees east of Jerusalem, or the equivalent of 170E longitude on our maps.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Shapiro continues to argue, that there is a discussion in halacha whether the day begins at sunset, Shekias Hachama, or at nightfall, Tzeis Hakochavim. All poskim agree with this latter position. Tzeis Hakochavim follows Shekias Hachama by the amount of time that it takes the sky to darken so that three stars are visible, when the Sun&rsquo;s inclination to the horizon is increased by approximately eight degrees. Tzeis Hakochavim is therefore approximately eight degrees east of Shekias Hachama. Hence, the very first Tzeis Hakochavim took place at a point very close to the 178E longitude, remarkably close (within two degrees) to the International Date Line. This incredible coincidence he feels is a strong support for his position, in that Hashem led the world convention to choose a point so close to the Torah date line.</span>

  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Summary</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">It should be noted, that although these last four opinions are generally not prescribed by today&rsquo;s poskim, they all nevertheless use the Baal Hamaor as their basis for deciding the location of the date line. The only issue on which they argue with him is where to start counting the 90 degrees.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30 c33"><span class="c4">In practice the poskim have narrowed the decision </span><span class="c0">halacha lema&rsquo;aseh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to four positions:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c48 c34 c32"><span class="c4">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date line is 90 degrees east of Jerusalem.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup>

  <p class="c26 c48 c34 c32"><span class="c4">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date line is 90 degrees east of Jerusalem but land connected to the mainland is to also be considered west of the date line.</span><span class="c19 c6">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup>

  <h1 class="c15 c31"><span class="c8 c13 c18">Living Beyond the Date Line</span></h1>
  <p class="c29 c24"><span class="c9 c22 c13"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Despite our delineation of the various opinions of the poskim, we still have some ways to go before we can apply the halacha in practice. With the conclusions reached above, we can now draw a gray area,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;spanning &frac14; of the globe, from 125E to 145W, that can be divided into three sectors. &nbsp;They are:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c14 c27"><span class="c4">Sector 1 - Points east of 125E and are west of 145W. Countries found in this sector include Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, eastern China, and Siberia. The Baal Hamaor opines that this area lies east of the date line. According to the &nbsp;opinions of Rav Tukatzinsky and others noted in the first chapter of this book, this area is located west of the date line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c14"><span class="c4">Sector 2- Points east of 125E that are not connected to a landmass, that protrude west of 125E, and that are west of the International Date Line. Countries found in this sector include Japan, New Zealand, and many of the islands of the Philippines. According to the Chazon Ish this sector &nbsp;lies east of the date line. Rav Tukatzinsky and Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer consider this area to lie west of the date line. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c14"><span class="c4">Sector 3- Points east of the International Date Line but west of 145W. The only frequently visited places in this sector are Hawaii and the western portion of Alaska. According to all opinions except for that of Rav Tukatzinsky, this area lies east of the date line. </span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">It would be presumptuous to attempt to resolve the issues that gedolim of the last hundred years have found to be elusive. Even the most formidable of poskim who have reached conclusions of their own are wary of challenging positions held by the greatest expert in this area of halacha, the Chazon Ish. This is especially true insofar as mitzvos d&rsquo;oraisa &nbsp;i.e. Shabbos and Yom Kippur are concerned.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Diametrically opposed views</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Chazon Ish was firm and uncompromising in his position. He instructed the students of Yeshivas Mir to observe Shabbos on the day that was considered Sunday in Japan, and to eat on the day that according to the calendar in Japan was considered to be Yom Kippur. The Chazon Ish considered those living in Japan who observed Shabbos on Saturday to be in error, as their original determination of the &nbsp;days of the week was &nbsp;based on erroneous information.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Tukatzinsky on the other hand was also just as firm in his decision to advise the visitors to Japan to observe Shabbos on the Japanese Saturday, and to fast on the day that the &nbsp;Jews in Japan considered to be Yom Kippur.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Both the Chazon Ish and Rav Tukatzinsky felt that anyone following the other&rsquo;s position was violating Torah laws which carried the &nbsp;most serious onesh</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">of sekila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">and kares. &nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Most contemporary poskim, when presented with opinions of Torah giants that are diametrically opposed, are reluctant to take a firm position.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;The Chazon Ish &nbsp;was held by all in the highest esteem as the undeniable expert in the field of the date line. This issue however was an area of uncharted waters and when the question was posed to the Gedolim of Eretz Yisroel in 1941 regarding when to observe Yom Kippur, most poskim did not side with the Chazon Ish.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;The problem of taking a firm position is further exacerbated by other issues that following the decision of the Chazon Ish raise. &nbsp;When the well learned Talmudic scholars of the Mir Yeshiva violate the sanctity of Shabbos in the presence of the residents of Japan who never heard of the Chazon Ish but who had always observed Shabbos on Saturday, the sanctity of Shabbos is seriously compromised.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Compromise Solution</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Some poskim have therefore proposed that because of our inability to make a ruling in matters that the greatest poskim have not come to a consensus, we have no choice but &nbsp;to adopt the more stringent position. These poskim recommend observing Shabbos on both Saturday and Sunday in all locations where the day of the week is uncertain.</span><span class="c19 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Other poskim have suggested that Shabbos be observed on Saturday but that one refrain from violating Shabbos on Sunday. Others propose that one refrain from</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;melachos </span><span class="c4">d&rsquo;oraisa only.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Others prefer that Shabbos be observed on Sunday but that one refrain from melacha on Saturday.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Each position leads to its own set of complexities. Even the cautious approach that some suggest, to keep Shabbos or at least a modified Shabbos on both Saturday and Sunday, can cause great confusion as different groups observe Shabbos differently on certain days. A resident of a country who has always observed Shabbos on Saturday, who sees a fellow Shomer Shabbos Jew wearing tefilin on Shabbos (Saturday), will feel that this tefilin wearer is not properly keeping Shabbos, is not showing respect for the day, and from a certain perspective his actions are in a way showing actual contempt of Shabbos, Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, one who keeps Shabbos for two days, not knowing with certainty which day is really Shabbos, is faced with the dilemma of which Shmoneh Esrei to say. If one says the Shabbos Shmoneh Esrei on a weekday, or the weekday Shmoneh Esrei on Shabbos, the tefila obligation is not fulfilled.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">Let us therefore attempt to address some of the questions the cautious compromise solution raises, and analyze its effects on the halachos of Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos, Tefila, Musaf, Tefilin, Sefiras Haomer and Yom Kippur.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <h3 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Zilzul Shabbos</span></h3>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos, showing contempt for the sanctity of Shabbos, is a matter of grave concern. Chazal have taken great measures to avoid situations that could lead to Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos, even in cases where by following the letter of the law, the sanctity of Shabbos is not at all violated.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">According to the opinion that Sunday in Japan is considered Shabbos, and that Saturday would be considered a weekday (Chazon Ish), tefilin would be worn on Saturday and the weekday tefila would be said. If one behaves in such a manner in front of other Jews who are of the opinion that Shabbos is to be observed on Saturday, (as is the generally accepted custom among the populace), then the sanctity of Shabbos in Japan would be diminished. People who are less versed in halacha might come to draw their own conclusions based on the behavior of those ostensibly better educated in Jewish law. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Simcha Zelig Riger</span><sup class="c9 c5"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;therefore suggested that on the day considered Shabbos by the local population, one must keep all the laws of Shabbos, i.e. refraining from all melacha, d&rsquo;oraisa and d&rsquo;rabanan, recite Kiddush, and the Shabbos tefila. The &nbsp;other day, &nbsp;the day observed because of the </span><span class="c0">safek</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;should be treated as a weekday, i.e. tefilin are worn</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c4">, the weekday tefila is said, and Kiddush is not. However, one must refrain from all melacha.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;This opinion is adopted by Rav Vosner in </span><span class="c0">Shevet Halevi</span><span class="c4">, and is the position recommended by the author of </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(with minor revisions as to the order of tefilos as will be explained shortly).</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The above however poses another difficulty. One who says the weekday tefila on Shabbos, or Shabbos tefila on a weekday, does not fulfill his obligation. By advising travelers to Japan to say the Shabbos tefila on Saturday so as not to confuse the Jews living in Japan, and avoid the problem of Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos, we have created a new, and possibly more serious sha&rsquo;ailo. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Sefer Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;addresses this issue by offering a novel approach. He recommends that the weekday tefila be said on both days, Saturday and Sunday, but that the following phrase be added before the conclusion of the bracha of </span><span class="c0">Shma Koleinu: &ldquo;Elokeinu v&rsquo;elokei avoseinu, r&rsquo;tzeh viminuchaseinu&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;. ki atoh mekadesh hashabos veshomea Tefilas amecha Yisroel berachamim.&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;In theory, all nineteen brochos of Shmoneh Esrei should be said on Shabbos, provided that a mention of Shabbos be included within the tefila. Chazal however felt that saying all nineteen brochos plus an addition for Shabbos would be too long to say on Shabbos. They therefore ruled that only seven brachos be said; the three opening brachos, the three closing ones, and a seventh bracha in the middle dedicated to Shabbos. It is for this reason that the normal Shabbos tefila does not include the thirteen middle brachos that deal with our personal requests. However in case of </span><span class="c0">safek, Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;rules that we may say the thirteen middle brochos that are normally said on weekdays, and add a mention of Shabbos; this would satisfy the obligation of both the weekday tefila as well as the Shabbos tefila. &nbsp;In this way one did in fact fulfill his obligation.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">This suggestion however is only a partial solution. </span><span class="c0">Yisroel Vehazemanim&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;recommendation cannot be applied to Musaf. &nbsp;Since it is Shabbos specific, we do not have the option of saying a weekday tefila with mention of Musaf. And if it would be said on a weekday, one encounters the serious problem of bracha levatala. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;therefore admits that since we have no choice in this matter, Musaf should not be said at all. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">But this solution leaves much to be desired. </span><span class="c0">Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is proposing that Musaf can never be said in Japan. While a convincing argument can be made to support this position, poskim find this difficult to recommend.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The author of </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;has therefore developed an interesting alternative solution. There are times, when it is impossible to daven verbally, that many poskim advise that bedieved, tefila be said mentally, with </span><span class="c0">hirhur</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;For example, if a person is too ill to say the words of tefila, he may daven with </span><span class="c0">hirhur</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;In our case too, which would be considered bedieved, it is certainly advisable to daven Musaf with </span><span class="c0">hirhur</span><span class="c4">.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Tefilin</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Since Tefilin are not worn on Shabbos, wearing them in a situation where it is the custom that they not be worn, creates a problem of Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos. The performance of an ostensibly forbidden action in the presence of others who observe Shabbos, is a contempt of Shabbos, the permissibility of the action notwithstanding. However, it is only forbidden to wear tefilin on Shabbos if one intends to fulfill the mitzva of tefilin but not if one wears it for some other purpose.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;In our discussion above, since we are treating both days as a </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">, we can in fact wear tefilin on both days provided that we make the donning of tefilin conditional on our obligation to wear them. For example, on Chol Hamoed, when the obligation to wear tefilin is questionable, the </span><span class="c0">Mishna Berura</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;suggests that the tefilin be worn but that the following </span><span class="c0">t&rsquo;nai</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be said before donning them: &ldquo;If I am obligated to wear tefilin, then my wearing of them is for the purpose of the performance of the mitzva. If on the other hand it is not obligatory, then I am not wearing them for the purpose of the mitzva&rdquo;. Therefore, in our case, tefilin should be worn on both days without a bracha, and that the </span><span class="c0">tnai</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or condition suggested by the </span><span class="c0">Mishna Berura</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;with regard to Chol Hamoed be said prior to donning them. &nbsp;Needless to say, the tefilin should be worn in the privacy of one&rsquo;s home so as not to raise questions of Zilzul</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Shabbos and possibly compromise the sanctity of the day for others.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15 c39"><span class="c4"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Sefiras Haomer</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If a person is uncertain of which is the proper day of the sefira, because he is uncertain on which side of the date line he is located, he may choose to treat both days as a </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">. It would then seem logical to count both days. At first glance it would appear that there is no harm in counting an extra day. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Tshuvos Dvar Avraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;however opines that nothing is accomplished by counting an extra day in cases of uncertainty. He argues that when one is in doubt and counts both days, (e.g. by saying &ldquo;Today is day number five&rdquo; and moments later saying &ldquo;Today is day number six&rdquo;), he clearly indicates that he is uncertain of the correct day. Knowing the proper day to be counted is the entire crux of counting Sefira.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;A questionable count is no count at all. In such a case, no count should be said altogether.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;suggests that one who is in a place with an uncertain date, should count the day that the locals consider to be the proper day, and then afterwards count the day in question </span><span class="c0">misafek</span><span class="c4">. He reasons as follows. In the first place, the position adopted above with regard to Shabbos, considers the day of the week accepted by the local population as the primary day. The other day (i.e. Sunday in Japan or Friday in Hawaii) is observed only in a minor way. Hence, we could certainly rely on this position with regard to the counting of Sefiras Haomer. &nbsp;Secondly, </span><span class="c0">Dvar Avraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;himself cites the Ran and Baal Hamaor who claim that one may count both days in cases of </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">. And lastly, even </span><span class="c0">Dvar Avraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;says that one can count two days </span><span class="c0">misafek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;without a bracha. Hence, </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;rules that both Sefiros be counted</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span class="c4">; the first with a bracha should be the day that the local population follows, and the second count is that of the day in question.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15 c39"><span class="c4"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Yom Kippur</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">As we explained in our introduction, the date line question as it relates to Yom Kippur was the springboard for much of the discussion on the topic. Even though we have listed many poskim who feel that one should be stringent and keep two days Shabbos in cases of </span><span class="c0">safek </span><span class="c4">d&rsquo;oraisa, it is difficult to demand that one keeps two days Yom Kippur as this may lead to situations of danger to life, </span><span class="c0">Pikuach Nefesh</span><span class="c4">.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span class="c19 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The author of </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;therefore proposes that the approach to the </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Yom Kippur be treated in the same way as we dealt with Shabbos. The day that the local population considers to be the day of Yom Kippur must be kept as Yom Kippur. &nbsp;On the other day, which is the </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day</span><sup class="c9 c5"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c4">, one must refrain from all melacha. However, with regard to fasting, only if one is absolutely certain that he would not be putting himself into any danger whatsoever, may he fast on the </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day. Even so, it is preferable for one who feels strong enough to fast on both days, to eat only less than the </span><span class="c0">shiur</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to avoid any questions of </span><span class="c0">pikuach nefesh. </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;If one finds that even this recommended practice is too difficult to follow, one may rely on those who rule leniently and not fast at all on the </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c4">.</span>

  <h1 class="c15 c31"><span class="c8 c13 c18">Crossing the Date Line</span></h1>
  <p class="c29 c24"><span class="c9 c22 c13"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Up to this point, we have dealt with the halachic definitions of the date line, and how that impacts upon the inhabitants of those parts of the world affected thereby. This chapter is devoted to the halachic ramifications resulting from crossing the date line.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">A non-stop flight from New York to Taiwan leaves that New York at noon on Sunday arrives in Taiwan fifteen hours later at 3 AM Monday New York time which is Monday 4 PM local time. &nbsp;Eleven time zones have been crossed. As one travels from east to west, each time zone crossed moves the clock back one hour. The apparent movement of the sun vis-a-vis the traveler is therefore only four hours (15-11=4). &nbsp;All fifteen hours of this flight took place during daylight.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line was crossed approximately seven hours into the flight, the International Date Line was crossed about three hours later, while the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s and Chazon Ish&rsquo;s date line was crossed less than one hour before landing. Hence, local time in Taiwan upon landing is 4 PM on Monday rather than 4 PM on Sunday. Upon deplaning it is time for Monday Mincha. How does one compensate for Sunday&rsquo;s Mincha and Maariv, as well as Monday&rsquo;s Shacharis?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If Sunday was a fast day, when may one eat? Does the fast end when the day/date changes midday? Or must one wait until nightfall? Since the plane landed in Taiwan on a Monday afternoon, and Monday was not a fast day, may our traveler eat even though he saw no sunset? </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the return flight, a common departure time from Taiwan is 10 AM. The Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s date line is crossed about one hour into flight, the International Date Line about five hours after takeoff, and Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s at about eight hours into the flight. One who leaves Taiwan at 10 AM on Monday (Sunday 9 PM in New York) will arrive in New York 13 hours later at 10 AM Monday. However since the direction of this flight is eastward, in these thirteen hours one flies through a sunset and second Monday morning sunrise. Having davened Shacharis on Monday morning before leaving Taiwan, must one daven Shacharis again upon arrival in New York? Must one daven Mincha again on Monday afternoon in New York after having said Mincha on the plane on Monday afternoon? Must one don tefilin a second time? If the Monday that one left Taiwan was a fast day, may one eat as soon as he sees darkness? Must one fast again when the sun rises for our traveler&rsquo;s second Monday?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If one left Taiwan on Friday morning traveling eastward, did Shabbos begin for him when the sun set? Assuming that Shabbos did begin, what happens when he crosses the date line and Friday night becomes Thursday night? Is Shabbos over?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">In order to gain an understanding as to how crossing the date line affects each area of halacha, we must first clearly define the precise criteria within specific categories of mitzvos that obligate the performance of each mitzva, and apply our findings accordingly.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Shabbos</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Shabbos is clearly determined by location, i.e. the place that one finds himself when Shabbos begins.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shabbos is on the seventh day of the week anywhere in the world, the week being defined as the seventh day of the seven day cycle beginning from the time of creation. It is not at all dependent on a person&rsquo;s personal count of seven sunrises and sunsets. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The poskim deal with two basic problems; how one is to behave if he crosses the date line during Shabbos to a place where it is no longer Shabbos, or the opposite, when he crosses the date line from where it is no longer Shabbos to where it still is. When one crosses on Shabbos to a place where it no longer Shabbos, is the day cut short, and can one stop observing Shabbos in the middle of the day? On the other hand, when going from a place where it is no longer Shabbos to a place where it is still Shabbos, must he observe Shabbos again? Must one refrain from melacha on this second Shabbos, and must one say Kiddush even after having just recited the Havdala? </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">With regard to the former question- can Shabbos be cut off midstream- </span><span class="c0">Sefer Eretz &nbsp;Zvi</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;is of the opinion that an individual has a personal obligation to complete the full 24 hours of Shabbos even if he now finds himself in a place that is no longer observing Shabbos.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Chazon Ish on the other hand feels that Shabbos is determined by location only. Hence, if one crosses the date line on Shabbos, from a place that is still observing Shabbos to a place where Shabbos ended, then this person&rsquo;s Shabbos ended early. This latter opinion is supported by </span><span class="c0">Bezel Hachochma</span><span class="c4">, Rav Ben Zion Abba Shaul, Rav Chaim Pinchos Scheinberg and Rav Chaim Kanievsky</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt69" id="ftnt_ref69">[69]</a></sup><span class="c4">. Rav Kanievsky however cautions, that one must do all in his power to refrain from cutting his Shabbos short, except in case of great necessity.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Regarding the latter question- do we so to speak turn the clock back- where one who has already completed his 24 hours of Shabbos flies to an area where Shabbos is still being observed,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt70" id="ftnt_ref70">[70]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;since Shabbos is determined by the day of the week, one must refrain from melacha when one reenters his second Shabbos. Location determines the advent of Shabbos.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt71" id="ftnt_ref71">[71]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c4">With regard to the obligation of reciting Kiddush when one reenters Shabbos, we find differing opinions among contemporary poskim. Rav Gustman and Rav Scheinberg are of the opinion that Kiddush should not be recited again. Rav Eliashiv on the other hand feels that one who reenters Shabbos by crossing the date line must recite Kiddush.</span><span class="c19 c6">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt72" id="ftnt_ref72">[72]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Poskim raise a related question regarding the permissibility taking a flight which will bring a person into a situation whereby he reenters Shabbos. May one schedule a flight &nbsp;that leaves Taiwan at 10 AM on Friday and arrives in New York at 10 AM on Friday? At some point during the flight, depending on the season, the plane flies into the night before crossing the date line. When nightfall arrives, it is Friday night. Several hours later, as the date line is crossed, the day of the week reverts back to Thursday. Friday night (Shabbos) becomes Thursday night.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">There are a number of poskim who do not permit taking this flight. The objections raised are twofold. </span><span class="c0">Minchas Yitzchok</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;argues that flying a plane on Shabbos should be forbidden for the same reason that the Chasam Sofer objected to riding in a train. The Chasam Sofer bases his objection to riding a train on the Ramban in Parshas Emor. The Ramban says that an integral part of observing Shabbos requires one to rest on Shabbos. This obligation to rest is a halacha separate from the many halachos that call for refraining from doing melacha. &nbsp;He learns this from the positive command of </span><span class="c0">Tishbos</span><span class="c4">. When riding on a train that moves from side to side, one cannot rest as if he were at home, and one is unable to truly enjoy Oneg Shabbos. In essence, riding a train is not in the spirit of the day.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Minchas Yitzchok</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;equates the discomfort of having to fasten seat belts when riding through turbulence in today&rsquo;s modern planes, to a bumpy train ride to which the Chasam Sofer refers.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The second objection raised, is whether the flight should be disallowed because it may violate the laws of Techum Shabbos. There is an unresolved question in the Gemara whether the laws of techum apply to space above ten tefachim. If this unresolved question would be limited to d&rsquo;rabanan law, a lenient position may be adopted. However, when one travels beyond the twelve mil (approximately eight miles) limit, according to many, the techum question enters the d&rsquo;oraisa arena. Normally, the stringent position is adopted in unresolved d&rsquo;oraisa questions.</span><span class="c6 c19">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;proves that this latter question of techum is not a valid objection to the Friday flight. The twelve mil limit for techum d&rsquo;oraisa does not apply to trips over &nbsp;a carmelis. And since the entire Shabbos portion of the flight takes place over the ocean, a carmelis, the techum question can be no more than a d&rsquo;rabanan issue.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Furthermore, since flying home to join one&rsquo;s family for Shabbos is certainly considered to be a trip for the purpose of a mitzva, we may take the lenient position regarding techum.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">To counter the argument raised by </span><span class="c0">Minchas Yitzchok</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;goes to great lengths to prove that riding in a bumpy train is not a violation of the </span><span class="c0">Tishbos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;command. </span><span class="c0">Tishbos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is limited to actions which are related to melacha.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Gustman, Rav Eliashiv and Rav Scheinberg</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;all permit one&rsquo;s taking the flight in order to be home for Shabbos with one&rsquo;s family.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp; </span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Matzo, Shofar, Megila</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Performance of other mitzvos effected by the calendar, i.e. eating matzo on the 15</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;night of Nisan, blowing Shofar on the first day of Tishri, or reading the Megila on Purim, are not treated in the same manner as &nbsp;Shabbos. In the case of Matzo or Shofar, once the mitzva specific to that date is performed, it need not be performed again until the next cycle of its obligation. While this definition of date related mitzvos is not universal, it is certainly accepted by the majority of opinions.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The difference between Shabbos and Matzo can best be illustrated as follows. Suppose the first day of Pesach falls on a Shabbos. On Friday night, a person just west of the date line ate matzo and made Kiddush. At the conclusion of Shabbos immediately after nightfall on Saturday night, he flies eastward, over the date line into Friday night. While one must refrain from doing melacha again because one now finds himself in a location in which Shabbos is being observed, this traveler need not eat matzo again because the mitzva had already been performed the night before. This person already fulfilled his annual obligation to eat matzo this Pesach, and the fact that Pesach has somehow reappeared, does not form a new obligation for Matzo. Matzo is a personal mitzva, to be performed once a year on the 15</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;night of Nisan. It is not at all dependent on location. Shabbos on the other hand, is determined only by the day of the week dependent upon one&rsquo;s location, not the calendar date. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c5 c25 c8">Chanuka</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The lighting of Chanuka candles is a mitzva performed on an annual cycle, similar to the above mentioned mitzvos of Matzo, Shofar, and Megila. Chanuka, &nbsp;however has one distinctive character. The mitzva calls for one to light candles on each night of eight nights starting on the 25</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of Kislev. Hence, all days following the first day are not date specific.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; We simply add one candle on each subsequent night.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt82" id="ftnt_ref82">[82]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Therefore, if one crossed the date line in an eastward direction, from Taiwan to New York, although one experiences a new night which would obligate one to light candles again, it would also call for the addition of one candle, as this is the performance of the next night&rsquo;s mitzva, even though the date has actually moved backwards.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Carrying this argument through to its logical conclusion, the traveler from Taiwan to New York is actually observing a different night of Chanuka than New Yorkers. Consequently, Chanuka ends on the 7</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of Chanuka in New York for this traveler, for he has already lit candles on eight nights.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, a trip in the opposite direction, from New York to Taiwan, whereby a day is actually lost in transit, would necessitate the traveler to observe Chanuka for only seven days.</span><sup class="c9 c5"><a href="#ftnt83" id="ftnt_ref83">[83]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">This view is adopted by Rav Y.S. Eliashiv.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt84" id="ftnt_ref84">[84]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Eliashiv feels that Chanuka is not date specific and an additional day of Chanuka begins at one&rsquo;s personal experiencing a new nightfall. Rav Eliashiv however states, that the number of candles that one actually lights is to be consistent with the number of days being observed by the local population.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt85" id="ftnt_ref85">[85]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; With regard to lighting candles on the 8</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of Chanuka in New York, </span><span class="c0">Bezel Hachochma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;states that even though for this traveler Chanuka ended a day earlier, he must nevertheless light candles because of </span><span class="c0">chashad</span><span class="c4">, lest anyone suspect that this person is not observing the mitzva of candle lighting.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt86" id="ftnt_ref86">[86]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Chaim Kanievsky and Rav Scheinberg however take a different approach to the mitzva of Chanuka.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt87" id="ftnt_ref87">[87]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;They see it as being date specific, similar to Matzo and Shofar. They therefore feel that one who travels in an eastward direction moving the date backwards, does not have to light candles again when he arrives in New York if he already lit candles for that night in Taiwan.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt88" id="ftnt_ref88">[88]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Conversely, one who travels in a westward direction, thereby losing a day as the date is pushed forward, lights the number of candles that the local population lights. Chanuka is determined by location, so in effect a day is lost. This person would light candles on only seven nights that year.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt89" id="ftnt_ref89">[89]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c5 c25 c8">Bris Mila, Pidyon Haben, Bar Mitzva</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">At first glance, it would seem that Mila, Pidyon Haben, and Bar Mitzva, would not be determined by the world date. Since a Bris is performed when the boy is eight days old, crossing the date line does not make a seven-day old boy, eight days old. &nbsp;The same applies to the counting of thirty days for Pidyon Haben or thirteen complete years for Bar Mitzva.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The above is the position of Rav Bezalel Stern in </span><span class="c0">Bezel Hachochma</span><span class="c4">.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt90" id="ftnt_ref90">[90]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Stern opines that mitzvos that are dependent on the calendar such as Shofar, Lulav and Matzo are effected by the date change of crossing the date line. Mitzvos that are dependent on a person&rsquo;s age, i.e. the sum of the sunrises and sunsets that this individual has experienced, are not.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Bezel Hachochma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;offers the following hypothetical argument to support his opinion.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt91" id="ftnt_ref91">[91]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Halacha requires that the parshiyos of tefilin must be written in a specific order.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt92" id="ftnt_ref92">[92]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; The writing of the parsha of </span><span class="c0">Shma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;must precede the writing of the parsha of </span><span class="c0">Vehaya</span><span class="c4">. Suppose a sofer in China wrote the parsha of </span><span class="c0">Shma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on a Monday, and then flew to New York that very afternoon. When he crossed the date line during this flight, the calendar day moved back from Monday to Sunday. After crossing the date line the sofer writes the parsha of </span><span class="c0">Vehaya</span><span class="c4">. Could one possibly argue that the writing of </span><span class="c0">Vehaya</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on Sunday preceded the writing of </span><span class="c0">Shma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on Monday? Rav Stern therefore concludes that mitzvos that are dependent on the individual cannot be affected by the calendar date.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Yechezkel Roth in </span><span class="c0">Emek Hateshuva</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;offers a dissenting view.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt93" id="ftnt_ref93">[93]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Roth quotes a Yerushalmi which discusses the halachic ramifications of a minor girl&rsquo;s third birthday. For example, prior to that date, one who has illicit marital relations with her, does not incur the Torah&rsquo;s prescribed penalty. Afterwards he would. However, if her birthday takes place in the month of Adar, and Beis Din then decreed that a month be added to the year thereby making it a leap year, the aforementioned act committed during the extra month, would still be considered happening prior to her third birthday. Her position as a three year old has been reversed. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Sefer Yemei Nechemia</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;makes the same argument for a boy who turns thirteen during Adar. Although he may have been considered a </span><span class="c0">gadol</span><span class="c4">, an adult, for 29 days of Adar, if Beis Din decreed a leap year, his status for the prior 29 days has just changed from </span><span class="c0">gadol</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c0">katan</span><span class="c4">.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt94" id="ftnt_ref94">[94]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; In short we see that the clock can be turned back.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">To counter this argument, Rav Scheinberg claims that there is a significant difference between the case of the leap year and our case of crossing the date line.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt95" id="ftnt_ref95">[95]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Where the Beis Din decrees a leap year, there is a date change in the world and all calendars are set back. There is so to speak a physical change in the world which would change the status of a </span><span class="c0">gadol</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to a </span><span class="c0">katan</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Crossing the date line on the other hand is a very individual matter. Rav Scheinberg therefore holds that with regard to Bris Mila and Pidyon Haben, the time is determined by one&rsquo;s personal count and not the date. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Chaim Kanievsky in principle</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt96" id="ftnt_ref96">[96]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;is in agreement with the view of Rav Roth with regard to the time of Bris Mila and Pidyon Haben. He holds that a baby born on a Monday who crossed the date line in a westerly direction (thereby losing a day as the date is pushed forward), would have his Bris on the following Monday rather than on Tuesday. &nbsp;The determinant for Bris is the date, not the personal day count.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt97" id="ftnt_ref97">[97]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Eliashiv is of the opinion that the determining factors for the timing of the three halachos of Bris Mila, Pidyon Haben, and Bar Mitzva, are not necessarily consistent. While Bris and Pidyon Haben are determined by the personal count, Bar Mitzva is different. Bar Mitzva is an anniversary date of when a boy becomes 13. It is not a count of the number of days since his birth. Since each year has a different number of days, the day count is irrelevant. Rav Eliashiv therefore holds that although Bris Mila and Pidyon Haben are determined by the person&rsquo;s actual age, the time of the Bar Mitzva is decided by the date.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt98" id="ftnt_ref98">[98]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The net result of the above can be summarized as follows. </span><span class="c0">Bezel Hachochma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and Rav Scheinberg feel that the eight days of Bris Mila, thirty days of Pidyon Haben, and thirteen full years until Bar Mitzva, are determined by the person&rsquo;s actual age, as these milestones reflect the individual&rsquo;s having reached a certain stage in life. Crossing the date line will have no effect on these days. So a child born on a Monday who crosses the date line from New York to China before his Bris, must wait until he has seen seven sunsets. Hence the Bris will take place on Tuesday in China.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt99" id="ftnt_ref99">[99]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Chaim Kanievsky on the other hand feels that these mitzvos are date specific. A child born on a Monday who travels from New York to China before his Bris, must have his Bris on Monday in China. The same would apply to the timing of his Pidyon Haben and Bar Mitzva.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Eliashiv&rsquo;s opinion is that although the time of a Bris Mila or Pidyon Haben are determined by the personal day count of the child, with regard to Bar Mitzva, the date is the factor that sets the time of the event.</span>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">With regard to a woman counting the seven clean days before immersing in the mikva, everyone</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt100" id="ftnt_ref100">[100]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;agrees that the determinant is the personal count. This is because the Torah says regarding this count, </span><span class="c0">vesafra lah,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;she must count to herself. &nbsp;Hence a woman who made her hefsek tahara on Monday afternoon, would immerse herself in the mikva on the following Monday night after nightfall- Tzeis Hakochavim.

Some poskim</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt102" id="ftnt_ref102">[102]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;feel that she must wait until the time of Tzeis in New York to immerse herself in the Mikva. However, the great majority of poskim</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt103" id="ftnt_ref103">[103]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;conclude that she may immerse herself at the time of Tzeis wherever she is located.</span>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The halacha demands that a woman must anticipate her monthly cycle in order to assure the prevention of transgressing the laws of Niddah. Some women have very regular cycles and can accurately anticipate the day and sometimes even the hour when their cycle will commence. Since most women however have an irregular cycle, the halacha prescribes that they anticipate their cycle on three days of each month. The three days are referred to as </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">- the calendar date of her last period, </span><span class="c0">Vest Haflaga</span><span class="c4">- the interval since her last period, and </span><span class="c0">Ona Beinonis</span><span class="c4">- the average interval which is either 30 or 31 days since the last period.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If her cycle began on the 10</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of Kislev, then the woman must anticipate the cycle on the 10</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of the following month, Teves. Since this Ve</span><span class="c0">st Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is date specific, crossing the date line has a very definite effect on when to anticipate her next period, i.e. she must anticipate the </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on the 10</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Teves wherever she is.

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Some illustrated examples would be appropriate. If a woman crossed the date line on the day of her </span><span class="c0">vest</span><span class="c4">, in an east-west direction, (e.g. from New York to Taiwan), she might completely miss the day that she must anticipate her period. A plane that leaves New York at midnight on Sunday, arrives in Taiwan early Tuesday morning. If her </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;fell out on Monday, she would have no </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that month.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt107" id="ftnt_ref107">[107]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;On the other hand, if she flew in a west-east direction on the day of the </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">, she would keep two days that month. If the date repeats itself, then </span><span class="c0">Vest Hachodesh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;being date sensitive, repeats itself as well.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt108" id="ftnt_ref108">[108]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c0">Vest Haflaga</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;interval is a personal count. If the interval between her previous cycle was 28 days, then she must count her personal 28 days to predict when her next period will commence. Consequently, crossing the date line has no effect whatsoever. The woman is only required to count sunsets .</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt109" id="ftnt_ref109">[109]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The </span><span class="c0">Ona Beinonis</span><span class="c4">, is for all intents and purposes a variation of the </span><span class="c0">Vest Haflaga</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;interval cycle.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt110" id="ftnt_ref110">[110]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;It therefore has the same halachos as the </span><span class="c0">Vest Haflaga</span><span class="c4">, and crossing the date line has no effect on the </span><span class="c0">Ona Beinonis</span><span class="c4">.</span>

  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Tefila</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Tefila presents a traveler with the most common dilemmas. Must one daven a second time if the day repeats itself? Is Tefila day or date sensitive?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Since one must daven three times a day, the question raised among poskim is how to define the day of Tefila. The daily obligation to daven can be understood to be the same as an annual obligation to eat matzo. Once a person has performed the mitzva on a particular day, the obligation of the next day&rsquo;s Tefila does not commence until the next cycle, which in this case is the next day. The question among poskim however is how to define the next day. There are two diametrically opposing views in this matter.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The opinion of Rav Stern is that the obligation for a new tefila is to be determined by each person&rsquo;s personal day, i.e. every sunrise and sunset that one experiences forms a new personal obligation for Tefila. Therefore, if one experiences two sunrises on the same day of the week, he must daven Shacharis twice on that day</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt112" id="ftnt_ref112">[112]</a></sup><span class="c4">. </span><span class="c0">Sefer Lehoros Nosan</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;expands on this idea.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt113" id="ftnt_ref113">[113]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;He feels that laws are given to man in a way that the common person understands. To obligate one to become a calendar expert &nbsp;in order to know when to daven is inconceivable. To bolster his position, he notes that the obligation to daven each day is learned from the pasuk </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;U&rsquo;beirach es Lachmecha&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">, one must pray for daily sustenance.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt114" id="ftnt_ref114">[114]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;This is a personal day, not a calendar day.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rav Roth on the other hand sees Tefila as a mitzva to be performed only once each day. Just as Matzo has a time cycle of once a year, Tefila has a time cycle of once a day. He therefore holds that if one experiences two sunrises on the same day of the week, there is an obligation of only one tefila.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt115" id="ftnt_ref115">[115]</a></sup><span class="c4">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, if one crosses the date line in an east-west direction, (thereby pushing the day forward), their positions are switched. Rav Roth who holds that the trigger to obligate Tefila is the daily obligation, posits that since the day has changed a new Tefila obligation has been created .</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt116" id="ftnt_ref116">[116]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; Rav Stern, who is of the opinion that no new tefila is required unless one experiences a new sunrise or sunset, claims that a tefila obligation is not formed by this date line crossing. </span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15 c39"><span class="c4"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">The Compromise Option</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;proposes a unique compromise position. As previously mentioned, Rav Stern holds that the trigger for new Tefila is the experience of a new sunrise or sunset. Rav Roth on the other hand states that once one has davened on a particular day of the week, no new tefila is required regardless of whether the day happens again. Even so, Rav Roth would agree that one may </span><span class="c4 c58">add</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a tefilas</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">nedava, a voluntary tefila. &nbsp;If so, where we have a machlokes whether or not a new tefila is required, one should say a tefilas nedava as prescribed by the Shulchan Aruch is cases of doubt. And whereas under normal conditions a tefilas nedava requires the inclusion of a personal request in </span><span class="c0">Shma Koleinu</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or before the conclusion of the tefila, it is not necessary here. When saying a tefilas nedava in the case of doubt, one has only to make the following condition: &nbsp;&ldquo;If I have not fulfilled my tefila obligation then may the following tefila be a tefilas chova, an obligatory one. If I have already fulfilled my obligation to daven, then may the following tefila be a tefilas nedava, a voluntary one&rdquo;.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt117" id="ftnt_ref117">[117]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Rosh Chodesh, Hallel, Musaf</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Rosh Chodesh presents us with a new set of questions as they relate to Hallel &nbsp;and Musaf. Consider the following. One travels from New York to Taiwan on the Sunday morning preceding Rosh Chodesh. He arrives in Taiwan on Monday (Rosh Chodesh) afternoon, in time to daven Mincha. When he davens, he must naturally include &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Yaaleh Veyavo</span><span class="c4">.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt118" id="ftnt_ref118">[118]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The date line was not crossed until some time in the afternoon. Both Rav Stern and Rav Roth would agree that since he did not daven Mincha for that day, he must daven upon arrival in Taiwan (Rav Stern considers it the Mincha for the day that he left New York, while Rav Roth holds it is Mincha of the following day). Nevertheless Rav Stern would agree that the traveler must say Hallel and Musaf for Rosh Chodesh on that afternoon, as Rosh Chodesh is determined by the date. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">A similar flight in the opposite direction, as &nbsp;Rosh Chodesh repeats itself when the date line is crossed, results in the following. Rav Roth would not require that Hallel and Musaf be repeated. Rav Stern, in addition to requiring one to repeat the daily tefilos, would require the repetition of both Hallel and Musaf. The compromise solution as suggested by </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would recommend that Hallel be said without a bracha, and that Musaf be said with </span><span class="c0">hirhur</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;only.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c8 c13 c25">Birchos Hashachar</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Birchos Hashachar are in a class of their own. Chazal required recital of the Birchos Hashachar when one rises in the morning, and receives his soul anew, to give praise and thanks as if he were created anew. Obviously, when one arises with a new sunrise regardless of the day of the week, he must offer this praise and thanks to Hashem. Furthermore, the Tur states that the morning brachos are actually Birchos Hanehenin. Just as one must make a Birchas Hanehenin in order permit the deriving of pleasure from a particular food, so too may one not derive the general pleasure of living before saying the Birchos Hashachar. The personal new day is therefore what rules</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt119" id="ftnt_ref119">[119]</a></sup><span class="c4">. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Birchos Pesukei Dezimra and Birchos Krias Shma</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Unfortunately, the aforementioned compromise solution cannot be offered with regard to Birchos Pesukei Dezimra and Birchos Krias Shma, as there is no </span><span class="c0">nedava</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;option. These brachos may only be recited once a day, and an unnecessary recital of these brachos constitute a bracha levatala. When one experiences a second sunrise on a particular day, although Rav Stern will hold that a new sunrise is the catalyst for Tefila and Birchos Krias Shma , Rav Roth would hold that the recital of a new set of Birchos Krias Shma is unnecessary, and constitute a bracha levatala.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;again offers a solution that can satisfy both opinions. In our discussion of how one can daven Musaf on a day that is </span><span class="c0">safek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Shabbos, we prescribed the advice that poskim offer in cases of </span><span class="c0">safek, tefila behirhur</span><span class="c4">, to daven mentally rather than verbally.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt120" id="ftnt_ref120">[120]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp; Here too, one can say these brachos mentally. There is of course no objection to say the actual Tehilim section of Pesukei Dezimra verbally. &nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Krias Shma </span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Krias Shma can be understood to fall into yet another category of time obligations. The requirement of Krias Shma is prescribed by the Torah to be b</span><span class="c0">eshochbecha u&rsquo;vekumecha</span><span class="c4">, when you go to sleep and when you wake up. The time to sleep and arise are clearly determined by the position of the sun. Hence all would agree that the obligation of Krias Shma is determined by sunrise and sunset</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt121" id="ftnt_ref121">[121]</a></sup><span class="c4">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c8 c13">Tefilin</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">There is a disagreement among the poskim whether Tefilin is a daily obligation or not. If we assume that Tefilin is a daily mitzva like Tefila, the aforementioned argument between Rav Stern and Rav Roth would apply. &nbsp;Rav Stern would require one to don tefilin each time he sees a new sunrise, as that triggers a new obligation. Rav Roth would hold that once tefilin are donned in its time cycle, there cannot be a second requirement. However, since all agree that tefilin may be worn many times daily, </span><span class="c0">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;suggests that one should don tefilin whenever one is in doubt whether or not a new obligation is established. The bracha on tefilin is to be said each time tefilin are worn, even if the daily obligation to wear them has already been performed (provided that there was </span><span class="c0">hesech hada&rsquo;as</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;between the two times that the tefilin are worn). &nbsp;Hence, when travelling in a westerly direction such that a new sunrise is not seen (e.g. New York to Taiwan), tefilin are donned during daylight hours with a bracha after the date line is crossed (assuming of course that crossing the date line took place during daylight hours when tefilin are normally worn). When it is crossed in an easterly direction, tefilin are worn after one sees a new sunrise regardless of whether the mitzva had already been performed on that day of the week already.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Other poskim hold that the obligation to wear tefilin is not a daily one, but rather tefilin are to be worn all the time. Consequently, crossing the date line or witnessing a new sunrise would have no effect whatsoever on the person&rsquo;s requirement to don tefilin.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt122" id="ftnt_ref122">[122]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Sefiras Haomer</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The mitzva of counting &nbsp;Sefiras Haomer begins on the second night of Pesach for 49 consecutive nights. If one forgets to count for an entire day he may no longer continue counting with a bracha. &nbsp;When one crosses the date line in a westerly direction (from New York to Taiwan), a day is lost in flight. Since it is a calendar day only, he will not lose the opportunity to complete Sefiras Haomer with a bracha. The count of the following day should be said immediately upon crossing the date line. The Sefira count is resumed on the following night with a bracha by counting the day that the local population does.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt123" id="ftnt_ref123">[123]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;On the other hand, when crossing the date line in an easterly direction, (and the day of the week repeats itself), the traveler would repeat the count of the previous night without a bracha, and will continue subsequently to count the same count as the local population with a bracha.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt124" id="ftnt_ref124">[124]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">We should note that there is an opinion that Sefiras Haomer is determined by one&rsquo;s personal count of days, not the world date. It claims that the mitzva </span><span class="c0">of usefartem lachem</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is identical to the </span><span class="c0">vesafra lah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Shiva Nekiyim insofar as they are both counts of personal days. If so, a traveler from New York to Taiwan would lose a day in flight, as one&rsquo;s personal count falls out of sync with the rest of the community, this individual would celebrate Shavuos &nbsp;a day later than the rest of the community. Conversely, one who traveled in an easterly direction from Taiwan to New York, would actually gain a day, and Shavuos would be celebrated a day earlier for this traveler.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt125" id="ftnt_ref125">[125]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">It should be pointed out that this is a minority opinion. Virtually all poskim disagree.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt126" id="ftnt_ref126">[126]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Fast Days</span></h2>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The Gemara states that &ldquo;any fast that did not see a nightfall is not a fast&rdquo;,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt127" id="ftnt_ref127">[127]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;i.e. a fast does not end until nightfall. If one flies eastward, from the U.S. to Israel on a fast day, one need not wait until the fast is over in New York, for the nightfall in Israel marks the end of the fast.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt128" id="ftnt_ref128">[128]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the other hand, what would the halacha be in the case where one flies &nbsp;eastward and crosses the date line in the middle of the day, (e.g. and 10 Teves became 9 Teves)? May one begin eating even though he has not seen a sunset, since he now finds himself in a place where it is not a fast day? Or must the person fast on the following day as well, when 10 Teves reappears?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Concerning the former question, Rav Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg and </span><span class="c0">Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;opine, that one may eat as soon as he crossed the date line from 10 Teves to 9 Teves. There can be no obligation to fast on a non fast day.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt129" id="ftnt_ref129">[129]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rav Eliashiv and Rav Chaim Kanievsky disagree.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt130" id="ftnt_ref130">[130]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;They feel that once a fast is begun, it cannot be terminated prematurely,</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt131" id="ftnt_ref131">[131]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;because one cannot renege on the initial Kabalas Hataanis.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt132" id="ftnt_ref132">[132]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c4">Regarding the latter question, all would agree that one must fast on the second 10 Teves as well. Although fast days are date sensitive, they are not like e.g. Matzo and Shofar. For in the case of Matzo and Shofar, when one eats the matzo or heard the shofar, the mitzva has been completed. In the case of fast days however, the completion does not occur until sunset. And since the calendar changed from 10 Teves to 9 Teves before sunset, there was never a completion of the fast. It must therefore be performed again when 10 Teves reappears the next morning.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If however one crossed the date line after sunset, having completed the fast on the first appearance of 10 Teves, one need not fast the following day. This would obviously be identical to &nbsp;Matzo and Shofar.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt133" id="ftnt_ref133">[133]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">When flying westward on the fast day, and 10 Teves becomes 11 Teves, the aforementioned machlokes would apply. Rav Scheinberg and </span><span class="c0">Yisroel Vehazemanim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would permit one to break the fast midday, while Rav Eliashiv and Rav Chaim Kanievsky would hold that one must wait until sunset.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt134" id="ftnt_ref134">[134]</a></sup>

  <ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="1">
    <li class="c21"><span class="c4">Baal Hamaor : Six hours or 90 degrees east of Jerusalem. This line is a straight vertical line at the 125.2E meridian.</span>

  <h3 class="c15"><span class="c25 c8 c13">Crossing the Date Line</span></h3>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">Mitzvos, affected by crossing the date line, can be classified as follows:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">a. Date sensitive mitzvos- &nbsp; Shabbos, Matzo, Shofar, Megila.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">b. Day sensitive mitzvos- The Niddah&rsquo;s seven day count of </span><span class="c0">Shiva Nekiyim</span><span class="c4">, seven days of </span><span class="c0">Aveilus</span><span class="c4">.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">c. Mitzvos effected by the advent of sunrise and/or sunset only- Birchos Hashachar, Krias Shma.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c20 c30 c32"><span class="c4">d. Mitzvos on which there is a disagreement among poskim whether they are day or date sensitive- Tefila, Mila, Pidyon Haben, Bar Mitzva.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c24"><span class="c4"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">When trying to formulate a practical guide for a traveler considering the many opinions on the various date line questions, we can design a simple grid for each country and for the specific mitzva in question, with any number of combinations and possibilities along the coordinates of this grid. The variables would be the opinions regarding the location of the date line, and how one views crossing the date line. If one obtains a clear psak as to which date line to accept, and a clear psak as to which of the opinions to follow regarding Tefila and crossing the date line, one must merely plot out his travel itinerary and apply the rules accordingly. &nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">Consider the following. A psak which takes into account the views of the Chazon Ish regarding the date line location, and Rav Betzalel Stern regarding crossing the date line would read as follows:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">When flying from New York to Japan, the date line is not crossed, and therefore no new tefila is required. On the return trip however, one must daven when a new sunrise or sunset is experienced. If the traveler stayed in Japan over Shabbos, Saturday should be treated as a weekday. Shabbos is to be observed on Sunday. Should the return trip include a stopover in Hawaii, by crossing the International Dateline between Japan and Hawaii, the Chazon Ish&rsquo;s day is brought back into sync with that which is accepted by world convention. Shabbos in Hawaii is on Saturday.</span>

  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">The same question for a trip to Korea would read quite differently, since according to the Chazon Ish the halachic date line is crossed in this case. While there would be no difference in this case regarding Tefila, as crossing the date line has no effect on the Tefila obligation, Shabbos would be observed on Saturday unlike Japan.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">When we alter the variables, by for instance substituting the opinion of Rav Stern with that of Rav Roth, a new set of halachos of a tefila pattern emerges. When one travels from Japan to New York one need not daven again, since the date line was not crossed to trigger the obligation for a new tefila even though he did see a new sunrise. On the trip to Korea, a new tefila is required even if no sunrise was witnessed because crossing the date line is what sets the requirement for Tefila. On the return from Korea, because the date line was crossed and the day is set back, even though sunset and sunrise were seen, a second tefila for that same day is not required.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c33 c30"><span class="c4">If we substitute Rav Tukatzinsky for the Chazon Ish in the above example, Japan would be treated in the same manner as Korea. On the other hand, when flying from Japan to Hawaii, since the International Date Line is crossed but Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line is not crossed until one has passed Hawaii, a stopover in Hawaii over Shabbos would require one to observe Shabbos on Friday. When returning to New York, Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line is crossed, and his day falls into line with that of the world convention.</span>

  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c4">A typical flight that leaves New York on Sunday at 1 PM arrives in Japan at 3 PM on Monday, local time. Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line as well as the International Date Line are crossed. During this flight, one does not experience a sunset. If one davened Mincha in New York on Sunday, upon arrival in Japan on what seems to be that same afternoon, having seen no sunset or sunrise one should say a tefilas nedava, preceded by saying the condition as mentioned above.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt142" id="ftnt_ref142">[142]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Tefilin should be worn again with a bracha.</span>

  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If this trip took place during Sefiras Haomer, when crossing the date line in a westward direction, the date is pushed forward midday, and one so to speak loses a day. However, since the entire day is not lost, one should count the appropriate day without a bracha as soon as the date line is crossed. When nightfall comes, one may resume counting with a bracha. &nbsp;Assume that Sunday was the 10</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of the Omer and the trip began on Sunday afternoon. When he arrives on Monday afternoon in Japan, it is the 11</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of the Omer. He must count day number 11 that afternoon without a bracha. On Monday night one may resume counting day number 12 with a bracha.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If one left New York on a fast day, for example Asara Beteves, as the date line is crossed, the date is pushed forward from 10 Teves to 11 Teves. Although some poskim are of the opinion that the fast is over, it is preferable to try to follow all opinions and fast until nightfall. If this is too difficult, one should at least try to eat less than a </span><span class="c0">shiur</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the prescribed time. If this is also too difficult, one may rely on the poskim who permit one to break the fast as soon as the date line is crossed.</span>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">A common flight from Japan to New York leaves Japan on Monday morning at 10 AM and arrives in New York on Monday morning at 10 AM By leaving at 10 AM one has an opportunity to daven only Shacharis. As the traveler flies eastward, he will experience a sunset several hours into the flight. Mincha should be said before seeing sunset and Maariv must be said after dark.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt143" id="ftnt_ref143">[143]</a></sup><span class="c4">. When the sun rises again several hours later, Birchos Hashachar must be said and tefilin must be donned with a bracha. Pesukei Dezimra are said, but the brachos of Pesukei Dezimra, as well as Birchos Krias Shma should be said mentally. &nbsp;A tefilas</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">nedava should be said.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt144" id="ftnt_ref144">[144]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If one left Japan on 10 Teves and flew into 9 Teves, according to some poskim one may eat when crossing the date line, as he is now in a place where there is no obligation to fast. Others feel that once a fast begins, it may not be cut short midstream. It is preferable to follow this opinion and to continue the fast until nightfall. Nevertheless, since the fast was never completed satisfactorily on the 10</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;day of Teves, one must fast when he sees sunrise on the following morning, his second 10 Teves. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If one must stay in Japan over Shabbos, since we are dealing with the most stringent laws of the Torah, one should observe both Saturday and Sunday to satisfy all opinions.</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt145" id="ftnt_ref145">[145]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;If one finds this too difficult, we advise the traveler to observe the complete Shabbos on Saturday, and refrain from at least melacha</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">d&rsquo;oraisa on Sunday.

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">Korea and Australia are considered west of the date line according to Rav Tukatzinsky as well as the Chazon Ish. Therefore a flight to these locations entails crossing the date line. The order of tefila is identical to that mentioned above regarding a flight to Japan.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">One who stays in Korea or Australia for Shabbos, keeps Shabbos on Saturday only. One may consider Sunday to be a weekday. However, there are a number of people who live in Australia who do not venture out to sea or go swimming on Sunday, because according to the Chazon Ish, the coastline is the date line, and while it may be Sunday on the land, it is Shabbos in the ocean. If one wishes to be stringent, and refrain from Melacha in Korea and in Australia on Sunday in areas east of the 125</span><span class="c19 c6">th</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;meridian, it is certainly considered praiseworthy. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On the return trip, the date line is crossed causing a day to repeat itself. &nbsp;The schedule of tefilos are the same as mentioned above regarding the Japan to New York trip. </span>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">On this trip, Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line is crossed. Therefore when one travels to Hawaii, the same rules that apply to the flight to Japan would apply here as well. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c15 c30"><span class="c4">If one stays in Hawaii over the weekend, the same halachos that apply to the Japanese Saturday apply to the Hawaiian Saturday.

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">In all of the above cases, mitzvos which are dependent on personal counts, such as seven days of Shiva, the seven clean days of a Niddah, eight days for Mila, thirty days of Pidyon Haben, the day of the week or date are not the deciding factors.

  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">If one started to sit Shiva in New York on Tuesday, and then traveled (due to extraneous circumstances) to Taiwan during Shiva, the Shiva period would end on Tuesday morning in Taiwan, rather than on Monday morning had he stayed in New York.

  </p>
  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">The rules for Mila and Pidyon Haben can be summarized as follows. Bris Mila would not be performed on a boy born on Tuesday in New York, until the following Wednesday in Taiwan, if the child traveled in a westerly direction, thereby crossing the date line. &nbsp;Conversely, the Bris for a boy born on a Monday in Taiwan, who subsequently crossed the date line in an easterly direction to New York, would take place on the following Sunday in New York. </span>

  <p class="c12"><span class="c4">With regard to Bar Mitzva, a boy who crosses the date line in a westerly direction, on a trip from New York to Taiwan, should wait the extra day before considering himself to be Bar Mitzva.

  </p>
  <p class="c29 c31"><span class="c5 c18">as it relates to the Date Line</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c31"><span class="c5 c18">by Dr. Ken Trabert</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c24"><span class="c5 c36 c18"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor received from his teachers an explanation of a difficult section of the Gemara in Rosh Hashana 20b, which deals with the criteria for establishing a new month in the Jewish calendar. The Baal Hamaor does not specifically mention a date line but the explanation of the Gemara which he offers and which we will attempt to describe below makes sense only if the concept of a date line is part of the tradition that he received.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor takes it as a given that the moon cannot be seen by anyone anywhere on Earth for a period of 24 hours following the molad (the instant when the moon passes the sun in the sky), because the position of the moon in the sky is then too close to the sun. The Gemara states before a new month can be declared as a result of the appearance of a new moon, two conditions must be met. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo; There must be a night and a day from the new&rdquo;.</span>
  </p>
  <ol class="c2 lst-kix_list_44-0 start" start="2">
    <li class="c3 c34 c45"><span class="c5 c6">&ldquo; The molad falls before noon or the molad falls after noon&rdquo;.</span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="c3 c34"><span class="c5 c6">These conditions which are the criteria for establishing a new month, are called by the Gemara the Sod Haibur.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor &nbsp;understands condition number 1 to mean that before a day can be declared Rosh Hashana (or the first of any month), the entire first day of the new month, the 24 hour period of the night followed by day, must occur after the molad. In other words, the first day of the month must take place </span><span class="c5 c58 c6">entirely</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;during the time of the new moon. However, this 24 hour period of the first day of the month, whereby the day is followed by the night, does not necessarily have to be according to Jerusalem time. If there is a single location on Earth which experienced a night and day after the molad in its local time zone, then a new month can be declared on that day of the week in Jerusalem.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">Condition number 2 means that if the molad falls any time after noon according to Jerusalem time, then the new moon cannot be seen on that day of &nbsp;the week anywhere on Earth. However, if the molad falls just one chelek (a chelek is 3-1/3 seconds and is a unit of measure in the Jewish calendar) before noon in Jerusalem, then it is possible for the moon to be visible somewhere on Earth that same day of the week based on local time in that location. For the moon to be visible, it is necessary for 24 hours to have passed since the molad as explained above because of the moon&rsquo;s proximity to the Sun. Hence, if the molad fell before noon in Jerusalem, there is a place on Earth which could have seen a night followed by the day that took place after the molad.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor offers the following illustration to make his point. It is assumed that at any given locality the day begins at 6:00 PM. The Baal Hamaor states that local time for those living at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">, the eastern edge of the Asian Continent 90 degrees east of Jerusalem (or 270 degrees west of Jerusalem) is 18 hours behind that of Jerusalem. Hence, if the molad were to fall just one chelek before noon in Jerusalem on Shabbos, then the molad would be at one chelek before 6:00 PM on Friday afternoon at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">. It would therefore be possible for the new moon to be seen 24 hours after the molad at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;just before the end of their Shabbos at one chelek before 6:00 PM. The entire Shabbos at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">, night followed by day, would fall after the molad and be entirely during the time of the new moon. The two criteria required to declare Rosh Hashana would be met. Rosh Hashana (or Rosh Chodesh) could therefore be declared in Jerusalem on Shabbos. If however, the molad fell after noon in Jerusalem, then the new moon could not be seen there until after Shabbos already began at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">; a full night of the new moon would not happen until the following night. Hence Shabbos cannot be declared Rosh Hashana in &nbsp;Jerusalem.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;The Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s explanation can only be understood if there is a date line separating the days between those just west of 90 degrees east of Jerusalem, and those just east of 270 degrees west of Jerusalem. Although the Baal Hamaor never specifically calls this point the date line, it is clear from his understanding of the Gemara, that the date must change at that point. For if the date changed at for example 89 degrees east of Jerusalem, both criteria of the Gemara could theoretically be met if the molad were any time before 12:04 PM Jerusalem time (the sun moves one degree in the sky during a four minute period). Thus when it is one chelek before 6 PM Friday at 89 degrees east of Jerusalem with the date line at 89 degrees east of Jerusalem, then it would be one chelek before 12:04 PM Shabbos in Jerusalem. Then all of Shabbos at 89 degrees east of Jerusalem with an international date line there would be after the molad</span><span class="c1 c6">. </span><span class="c5 c6">Similarly, if the date line would be at 91 degrees east of Jerusalem, then the molad criterion would be 11:56 AM in Jerusalem. Since the Gemara uses noon in Jerusalem as the critical time of the molad as its criterion, then the date change must take place precisely ninety degrees east of Jerusalem.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">We are faced with &nbsp;difficulties with regard to the above explanation of the Baal Hamaor.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">The Mishna in Rosh Hashana 2:6-7 clearly shows that the new month was declared by Beis Din on the basis of two witnesses who saw the new moon in Eretz Yisroel. However, in the illustration of the Baal Hamaor the new moon was seen on Shabbos only by those at Kzteh Hamizrach approximately 6,000 miles away from Jerusalem. The new moon was not seen in Jerusalem until Sunday. How could the Beis Din declare Rosh Hashana on Shabbos on the basis of witnesses?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor himself says that the preferred method of declaring Rosh Chodesh in the early generations was done on the basis of witnesses. If that was not feasible then Beis Din used the criteria of the Sod Haibur without witnesses to declare Rosh Chodesh. That is if the molads fell before noon then that day became the first of the month. When witnesses were used they were rejected if they said they saw the new moon within 24 hours of the molad. Then the new month was not declared in Jerusalem on the same day the molad fell, whether or not the molad fell before noon, because witnesses could not have seen the new moon during that same day in Eretz Yisroel.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">A question then arises. Why does the Gemara consider these criteria so important?</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">Rav Saadya Gaon quoted in Otzar Hageonim, Rosh Hashana 20b and Rabeinu Bachya in his commentary on the Torah, Parshas Bo, claim that the procedure for declaring a new month based on the testimony of witnesses was begun by Antignos Ish Socho who lived approximately 100 years after the building of the second Beis Hamikdosh. Before that time Beis Din relied on calculations only to decide when Rosh Chodesh would take place. According to this opinion, the main use of the Gemara&rsquo;s criteria was prior to the time of Antignos Ish Socho when the testimony of witnesses was not used. In addition, these criteria became important after Jews were driven from Eretz Yisroel when it was no longer feasible to use witnesses. Hillel Hakaton then established the Jewish calendar. According to the Baal Hamaor he relied on elements of the Sod Haibur. Hence the </span><span class="c1 c6">Sod Haibur</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;has important implications for the Jewish calendar.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">Perhaps it should be pointed out that under special circumstances it is just possible to sometimes see the new moon at the end of Shabbos in Eretz Yisroel in the example of the Baal Hamaor contrary to expectations. There are two types of molad of the moon, one is the true molad and the other is an average. The true molad is the actual instant when the center of the moon passes the center of the sun in the dome of the sky. The length of time it takes for the moon to go from one passage by the sun to the next passage by the sun a month later is variable. Sometimes the moon returns early and sometimes it return late. Over the decades the period of the moon&rsquo;s return oscillates about an average, which is the average length of the month, from one average molad to the next. Rabbi Gamliel in the Gemara Rosh Hashana 25a says that he has a tradition from his forefathers that the average length of the month which is the time from one avrage molad to the next, is 29-1/2 days, 2/3 hour and 73 chalakim. &nbsp;According to the tradition (see Tosafos Rosh Hashana 8a-b) the first average molad of creation fell at 8:00 AM Friday morning, the 6</span><span class="c50 c6">th</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;day of creation of the world, which was the day that Adam Harishon was created. In our calendar the year of creation is year One, and Adam Harishon was created on the 6</span><span class="c50 c6">th</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;day of creation which was the first day of the month of Tishrei of year Two. The average molad falls exactly 29-1/2 days, 2/3 hour and 73 chalakim after this first molad for each succeeding month, month after month, continuing until our time in the year 5759 and beyond. The molad announced in Shul is the average molad not the true one. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">If it is the average molad that falls just before noon in Jerusalem, then it is just possible to see sometimes the new moon that same day in Jerusalem. But if it is the true molad that falls just before noon in Jerusalem, then it is impossible to see the new moon that same day in Jerusalem. The Baal Hamaor does not explicitly say which molad he is using. Rashi, however, explains the Gemara differently than the Baal Hamaor. He says when the molad falls before noon in Eretz Yisroel, then the new moon can be seen in Eretz Yisroel that same day, but when the molad falls after noon in Eretz Yisroel, than the new moon can not be seen that same day in Eretz Yisroel. Rashi&rsquo;s explanation requires that the molad referred to in the Gemara be the average molad.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">In order to justify these statements about the true and average molad let us estimate how the true molad and the actual visibility of the new moon fits with the noon criterion of the Gemara using the average molad. According to Ibn Ezra, Parshas Bo, and the Sh&rsquo;ailos Vteshuvos Tashbatz, vol 1, no. 103, the true molad can be up to approximately 14 hours before or after the average molad. A similar difference was found in our times by Rabbi Dr. Hugo Mandelbaum in &ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c6">The Problem of Molad Tohu</span><span class="c5 c6">&rdquo;, Proceedings of the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientist&rsquo;s III-IV 1976 pages 65-84.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c26 c29 c20 c32"><span class="c4">Consider the case when the average molad falls just before noon in Jerusalem. Add to the six hours that there are from noon to the end of the day in Jerusalem, the 14 hours that the true molad can be earlier than the average molad, and we have 20 hours from a possible true molad to the end of the day in Jerusalem. The position of the moon in the dome of the sky separates from that of the sun approximately &frac12; degree each hour. Hence in the 20 hour span, the moon can separate from the sun by as much as 10 degrees. The Rambam in Kiddush Hachodesh 17:3-4 gives criteria for when one can see the new moon in Eretz Yisroel. He states that in the evening in Eretz Yisroel under certain circumstances, it is possible to see the new moon after it moves from the sun 10 degrees. But when their separation along their lines of motion in the dome of the sky is less than 10 degrees, then in general for all year around in Eretz Yisroel it is not possible to see the new moon in the evening. The criterion of the average molad falling just before noon is consistent with the most rare possibility of actually seeing the new moon in Eretz Yisroel that same day. &nbsp;</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">The criterion of the molad falling before noon in Jerusalem is also the same criterion used to determine Rosh Hashana in the Jewish calendar established by Hillel Hakatan. According to Rashi, not like the Baal Hamaor, this same criterion of the Gemara Rosh Hashana, was used by Beis Din to check witnesses in order to declare a new month. Thus, if the average molad fell after noon then witnesses were rejected if they said they saw the new moon before the end of the day. Rashi&rsquo;s analysis depends upon the difference of the true and average molad as we have described. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">Rambam&rsquo;s criteria can also be compared to the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s criteria for seeing the new moon. Rambam reports that if the moon and the sun are separated from each other by 15 degrees or more along their line of motions then in the spring the new moon can be seen readily throughout Eretz Yisroel (Kiddush Hachodesh 17:3-4). If the true molad were earlier than the average molad by even just 10 hours (not even the maximum of 14 hours) and the average molad were 20 hours (not even 24 hours) before sunset, then the moon should be about 15 degrees from the sun at evening. Hence, according to Rambam, in this case 20 hours after the average molad, the new moon could be seen in the evening in the spring throughout Eretz Yisroel. It would seem that this type ofcase is not rare (see Rabbi Dr. Hugo Mandelbaum loc. cit.). &nbsp;An example of an uncommon case was found by Rabbi Raphael of Hanover for the month of &nbsp;Sivan in the year 1598 when the new moon could be seen 12 hours after the average molad and 18 hours after the true molad according to Rambam&rsquo;s criteria (see for this and other cases Rabbi Raphael of Hanover, comments on Kiddush Hachodesh chapter 17, to be found in </span><span class="c1 c6">Sefer Halikutim</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;in the back of the Frankel edition of the Rambam&rsquo;s Mishna Torah).</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c6">The Baal Hamaor mentions, as before, if witnesses say they saw the new moon within 24 hours of the molad, they are rejected. This type analysis which worked well in Rashi&rsquo;s explanation does not seem to work well with the Baal Hamaor.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">There are two answers that might be given to this puzzle. One answer is that perhaps the Baal Hamaor is actually working with the true molad, even though from the overall context he seems to be speaking about the average molad. (Of course according to the Baal Hamaor, the location of the date line remains the same whichever molad is used). </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">According to Rambam&rsquo;s criteria the new moon can be seen even as early as 18 hours after the true molad. Nevertheless, it is hard to see the new moon within 24 hours of the true molad because the crescent of the moon is very thin and it is close to the light of the sun. Whereas the moon can be much further from the sun within 24 hours of the average molad in many cases so its crescent would appear larger and it would not be as close to light of the sun. Then sometimes within 24 hours of the average molad, the new moon could be seen obviously by everybody. Therefore the true molad criterion would appear to be a more reasonable standard to use to check witnesses.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">Another answer can be given to this puzzle. The Rambam&rsquo;s criteria for seeing the new moon are for a time about 1/3 of an hour after sunset, as he says at the end of chapter 14 in Kiddush Hachodesh. The Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s criteria are for the instant just before sunset. This can be seen from the fact that the Baal Hamaor said that the day changes for </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">, who are 18 hours behind Eretz Yisroel, when it is noon in Eretz Yisroel. Then the day changes at </span><span class="c1 c6">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;at 6 PM which is the time for sunset there.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;The Baal Hamaor is saying that the new moon can not be seen the instant before sunset if this time is less than 24 hours after the molad (meaning here the average molad). It is easier to see the new moon 1/3 hour after sunset when the horizon is darker than at the time of sunset, so Rambam&rsquo;s criteria are less stringent than the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s. The Baal Hamaor is not involved with the possibility of seeing the new moon after sunset when it is easier to see the new moon because the day changes with sunset. He is only concerned about seeing the new moon before the day has ended, which occurs at sunset in the tradition of the Sod Haibur.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">When the Baal Hamaor said that the witnesses were rejected if they said they saw the new moon within 24 hours of the molad he is referring to his cases by sunset. That is witnesses were rejected if they said they saw the new moon during the day or at sunset within a time period of 24 hours of the molad. But witnesses were not rejected if they said they saw the new moon 1/3 of an hour after sunset even if it were less than 24 hours from the molad. At this time the new moon definitely might possibly be seen throughout Eretz Yisroel and sometimes it could even be obviously seen by everybody. The Baal Hamaor is saying that by sunset it is not possible to see the new moon unless it is approximately 38 hours after the true molad when the moon can be as much as 20 degrees away from the sun. Perhaps this explanation resolves our puzzle.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c29 c20 c32"><span class="c5 c6">There is not a problem fitting Rashi&rsquo;s understanding of the Sod Haibur of the Gemara with Rambam&rsquo;s criteria because it is assumed that Rashi accepts the standard that the day changes a certain time after sunset, which is the Torah&rsquo;s standard. Rambam&rsquo;s criteria, as has been described, also are set for after sunset which is the usual time for seeing the new moon. So Rashi&rsquo;s criteria are compatible with seeing the new moon after sunset but before the beginning of the next day. The language of the Gemara Rosh Hashana 20b is that: If the molad occurs before noon then the moon can be seen close to sunset and if the molad falls after noon then the moon can not be seen close to sunset. Rashi interprets close to sunset to mean a little after sunset in Eretz Yisroel while the Baal Hamaor interprets close to sunset to mean at sunset itself at Kzteh Hamizrach. It is also clear from the above discussion that the criteria of the Sod Haibur are for the impossibility of seeing the new moon according to both Rashi and the Baal Hamaor. Neither say when one can definitely see the new moon.</span>

  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">Let us now turn to another difficulty that can be raised about the Baal Hamaor&rsquo;s explanation of the Gemara Rosh Hashana 20b. &nbsp;Why does he use criteria which are based on seeing the new moon anywhere on Earth? &nbsp;Shouldn&rsquo;t the concern be only for seeing the new moon in Eretz Yisrael? The following novel idea may be suggested as a possible explanation. The Pirkei D&rsquo;Rabi Eliezer in chapter 8 states that the Sod Haibur, was given by Hashem to Adam Harishon in Gan Eden. &nbsp;This Sod Haibur was passed down to the Avos but was lost when Bnei Yisrael were in Egypt. &nbsp;According to Pirkei D&rsquo;rabi Eliezer it was subsequently re-taught to Moshe Rabeinu and Aharon Hakohen in Egypt. The fact that the Sod Haibur was taught to Adam Harishon in Gan Eden explains why the whole earth was used to see the new moon. Adam Harishon would have based his clock and criteria in Israel where he lived, but since there were no countries or borders at that time, the entire world was then the place for seeing the new moon. &nbsp;The seeing of the new moon was therefore not restricted to Eretz Yisrael. &nbsp;Apparently this same tradition was re-taught to Moshe Rabeinu and Aharon Hakohen.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c26 c20"><span class="c4">An additional related novel idea might also be mentioned. According to the Sforno (Breishis 6:13 and 22:8) there were no seasons before the mabul. That is, the duration of daylight was equal to the duration of night everywhere all year around. The, the beginning of the next day was sunset at 6 PM all year around everywhere on earth. This same criterion was included in the tradition of the Sod haibur given to the Baal Hamaor.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c26 c20"><span class="c4">Independent of the fact that there were no seasons before the mabul, it also could be that then the moon was regular in its motions. That is with many revolutions of the moon the true molad point in time would coincide always with the average molad point in time. Hence no distinction between the molads was made in the explanation that the Baal Hamaor received from his teachers. Thus the Baal Hamaor does not mention explicitly which molad he is using.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c26 c20"><span class="c4">The Gemara in Sanhedrin 38b says that the day Adam Harishon was created consisted of twelve hours. But the Gemara in Avoda Zarah 8a seems to differ with the Sforno that there were no seasons before the mabul. The Gemara says that Adam Harishon saw the days were getting shorter and that he might be plunged into perpetual night. Then, Adam Harishon brought sacrifices for a week and saw that the days started to get longer. He realized that this was the way of nature. Since he only became concerned a week before the days became longer, maybe the shortening of the days he observed was much less than the shortening we see in our time. Since by him it was only a small effect there were no seasons and the sunset was still close to 6 PM throughout</span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3 c20"><span class="c5 c6">Perhaps a final comment should be made. The Sod Haibur and the establishment of the Jewish calendar are based on deeper considerations than simple calculations. Furthermore, today the true understanding of the Sod Haibur has been lost. Hence the above exposition does not in any way explain the Sod Haibur. </span>

This, claims the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Yesod Olam</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;is ridiculous. The Chazon Ish therefore introduces the concept of greira, literally dragged or pulled along with it. Land east of 90E attached to the mainland is dragged along with the mainland and is considered part of it.

    <p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref21" id="ftnt21">[21]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;A fascinating philosophic explanation of the views of the Chazon Ish and Rav Tukatzinsky has been offered by Dr. Eliezer Ehrenpreis. There is a machlokes in the Gemara Rosh Hashana 10b whether the world was created in Nisan or in Tishrei. Nisan, the onset of spring, when the flowers begin to blossom, the landscape is regaining its color, and the animals awake from their state of hibernation, represents a world in a fresh state of infancy and newness. Tishrei, the end of summer and the beginning of fall, represents a verdant world in its full state of maturity. The machlokes</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">can be understood to be a disagreement whether the world was created in a state of infancy or maturity. When it is noon in Jerusalem, the sun is setting over China 6 hours east. The Chazon Ish who claims that the day begins when it is sunset in China sees the beginning of the day as the point when it is noon in Jerusalem, the time of the mature day. Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s position however would seem to hold that the day begins when it is sunset 180 degrees east of Jerusalem, the corresponding time of sunrise in Jerusalem, when the day is new and in its state of infancy. Dr. Ehrenpreis related this explanation to Rav Moshe Feinstein zt&rdquo;l, and it met with his warm approval.</span>

In chapter 2 note 3, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach is quoted as having been extremely reluctant to issue a psak that was not in accordance with the Chazon Ish, as he held the Chazon Ish to be the expert in this field. However after having heard that Rav Moshe Feinstein agreed with the position of Rav Tukatzinsky, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach said that this opinion is the one to follow.</span>

Since Shabbos was the seventh day of creation, we keep Shabbos on the seventh day from the time that one starts his count as well. Chiya bar Rav is of the opinion that the person lost in the desert must keep the very next day as Shabbos, and each subsequent seventh day is to be considered Shabbos. &nbsp;Shabbos is determined by the count of Adam Harishon.

Similarly</span><span class="c1">, Sefer Yesod Olam</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;considers the first appearance of the Sun in determining the location of the date line, although he reaches a different conclusion. Sefer Yesod Olam accepts the Ba&rsquo;al Hamaor&rsquo;s date line, but he wishes to understand the origin of this shita in terms of Creation. He claims that the sun first appeared over the Pacific Ocean 90 degrees east of </span><span class="c1">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;so that the very first rays of daybreak shone over </span><span class="c1">Ktzeh Hamizrach</span><span class="c5">, the place where man would ultimately settle. According to this view, the sun first appeared 180 degrees east of Jerusalem. However, when studying the text of the Ba&rsquo;al Hamaor, no reference is made that there is a link between Creation and the date line location.

The following is an approximate illustration of a flight pattern from Korea to New York during November when the night portion of the flight is relatively long. The plane leaves Korea at 10 A.M. on Friday morning. &nbsp;At four hours after takeoff, sunset is seen. The plane&rsquo;s location is at 160E. Nightfall comes about 30 minutes later at 165E. The International Date Line is reached 30 minutes later when the plane reaches the 172E meridian (the date line zigzags in the North Pacific). One hour later, at about 6-1/2 hours into the flight, the Alaskan coast is reached. One hour later, 7-1/2 hours after takeoff, Rav Tukatzinsky&rsquo;s date line of 145W is crossed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c5">From the time that sunset occurs until the crossing the 145W meridian (approximately 3-1/2 hours), one must refrain from melacha. In the summer months, this period is considerably shortened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c26"><span class="c9 c5">With regard to Tefila, it is suggested that the reader first read the section of this chapter that pertains to the order of tefilos when crossing the date line. Having read that section, we can apply the rules as they pertain to Tefila as follows. If Maariv is said between hours 5 and 7-1/2, that is between nightfall and the crossing of the date line, the Shabbos Maariv would be said. That would present a serious problem for the traveler when he returns to New York on Friday morning. For when he goes to shul on Friday night, he cannot say Maariv again, having already said a Shabbos Maariv on the plane, according to the view of Rav Roth. Nor will the compromise option that is suggested regarding Tefila later in this chapter satisfy this condition, because a Tefilas nedava cannot be said on Shabbos. It is therefore recommended that one delay davening Marriv until after the date line is crossed. At that point it will be his second Thursday night. A tefilas nedava is in order as explained in the compromise option. One can then daven the Shabbos Maariv on Friday night in New York without any problems.</span>

Furthermore, Rav Auerbach held that as far as Tefila is concerned, if the day is repeated that the Tefila need not be repeated.

The Gemara states that the underlying principle of whether one lost in the desert and forgot which day is Shabbos keeps Shabbos on day number one or on day number seven, is based on the idea of whether we view cases of doubt from the vantage point of </span><span class="c1">kibriyaso shel olam</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c1">kibriyaso shel adam</span><span class="c5">. Chiya bar Rav, who says that the lost person keeps Shabbos on the first day that he becomes aware, views time from the perspective of </span><span class="c1">kibriyaso shel adam</span><span class="c5">, and &nbsp;Adam&rsquo;s first day was Shabbos. Rav Huna &nbsp;says that the lost traveler keeps day number seven as Shabbos, because we view time from the perspective of </span><span class="c1">kibriyaso shel olam</span><span class="c5">. Shabbos was the seventh day from creation. We could apply this same principle in theory only to the above machlokes- whether we claim that Tefila is to be determined by the </span><span class="c5 c58">personal</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;day of the week (Rav Stern) or the </span><span class="c5 c58">world</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;day of the week (Rav Roth).

The Australian Jewish community is over 200 years old and has always observed Shabbos on Saturday. According to all opinions except for those that follow the strict interpretation of the Ba&rsquo;al Hamaor, Australia is west of the date line. Furthermore, see </span><span class="c1">Iggeros Moshe Orach Chaim</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;IV No. 17 which states clearly that Klal Yisroel as a community cannot err. He strongly chastises the questioner for attempting to challenge an accepted practice. See also </span><span class="c1">Encyclopedia Talmudis</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; vol 22 p. 675 where Rav A. Kalatzkin in </span><span class="c1">Sefer Chibas Kodesh</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;states that &rdquo;</span><span class="c1">raglei chasidav yishmor</span><span class="c5">&rdquo; those that observe Shabbos with sincerity will certainly not err. Nevertheless, </span><span class="c1">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;2:14-16 cites a number of poskim who suggest that one refrain from melacha</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">d&rsquo;oraisa on Sunday in Australia.</span>

    <p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref143" id="ftnt143">[143]</a><span class="c5">&nbsp;An interesting question is hereby raised. According to the opinion of Rav Roth, we face the following dilemma. When one travels eastward, setting the day back, the tefilos that have already been said for that day need not be repeated. In the case where a traveler leaves Hong Kong on Monday afternoon when it is time for mincha, and will arrive in New York on Monday afternoon with enough time to daven mincha, must he daven in Hong Kong when the opportunity to daven Mincha presents itself, or should he wait until he arrives in New York, where davening with a minyan is available. </span><span class="c1">Taarich Yisroel</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;4:23-24 &nbsp;studies this issue at some length and concludes that one must daven during the first Mincha opportunity.</span>

Bezel Hachochma argues that the new personal day is the obligator for a new Tefila. We therefore recommend a Tefilas nedava as a compromise. Birchos Hashachar and Krias Shma however, must be said, as these are clearly determined by one&rsquo;s personal day (although we did note above that Rav Roth alone offers a dissenting view with regard to Birchos Hashachar).</span>
